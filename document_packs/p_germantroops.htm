      passing through a village in East Prussia, undated. 
      <br><br> Soon after the outbreak of war in August 1914, Russian troops poured 
        into the German territory of East Prussia and made some striking initial 
        gains. However, they were soon heavily defeated at the Battles of Tannenberg 
        and the Masurian Lakes in late August and early September. These colossal 
        victories allowed the German army to re-establish its authority in East 
        Prussia and begin a successful counter-offensive. This photograph, which 
        was probably taken in the autumn of 1914, shows a group of good-humoured 
        German soldiers passing through an un-named village. They are presumably 
        heading eastwards towards the territories of the Russian empire. <br>
