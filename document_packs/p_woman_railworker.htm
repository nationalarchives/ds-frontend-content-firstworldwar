      worker, undated. 
      <br><br> The transport industry was one of the largest wartime employers of British 
        women. This photograph shows a woman railway worker taking the number 
        of a train at an un-named platform station. Two men are looking on from 
        the train itself. Though it appears staged, the photograph probably offers 
        an unwitting insight into the division of labour between men and women 
        in the railway industry during the war. Though large numbers of women 
        were employed as station staff, far fewer were allowed to work as train 
        drivers.<br>
