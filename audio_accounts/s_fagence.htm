      <p>On going over the top for the first time at the Battle of Messines, June 
        1917. </p>
      <p><b>Transcript: </b>I think that if anything it was rather worse than, 
        you know... it was terrific, the noise and the explosions. There were 
        aero-shells going over and exploding on the enemy front line and some 
        going further over and exploding on the support lines. There was a certain 
        amount of German retaliatory fire until our troops advanced so that they 
        had to withdraw their guns further back, and there was quite a bit of 
        machine gun and rifle fire. And quite a number of our men got wounded and 
        some of them killed and some were even shaken off their feet by the vibration 
        of the earth...</p>
