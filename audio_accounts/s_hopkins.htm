      <p>On the intensified air attacks on German troops on the Western Front, 
        March 1918.</p>
      <p><b>Transcript: </b>We attacked usually roads, sometimes railways - anything 
        where we saw troop movement. But the principle target for attack just 
        for the first few days was the Albert Bapaume road, or rather the Bapaume 
        la Albert road on which the Germans were advancing rapidly and we simply 
        concentrated on that. The weather it so happened was very fine, bright 
        moonlight nights, we could see almost individual vehicles on the road 
        and troops. And we just went straight out there, dropped as many bombs 
        as we could - most of the bombs we used then were anti-personnel bombs 
        as against the larger high explosives we used to use for buildings. We'd 
        return as quickly as we could to our aerodrome and there would be intense 
        activity loading up the machine filling up with petrol, oil, getting ready 
        for the next show. </p>
