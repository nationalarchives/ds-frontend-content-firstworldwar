      <p>On the sinking of the<i> Indefatigable</i> at Jutland, 31 May 1916.</p>
      <p><b>Transcript: </b>A message came through that the flags were entangled 
        round the mast - somebody must go up. So I took my sea boots off, climbed 
        out the port-top, went up the Jacob's Ladder right to the very top. I 
        unfolded the flag and I sat on the wireless yard, looking around. I could 
        see all the German fleet and I made out roughly forty ships. There were 
        six of us, and I suppose we'd been in action about an hour and a half 
        or so when a shell or something hit the magazines. There was a terrific 
        explosion, the guns went up in the air just like matchsticks - twelve-inch 
        guns they were - and she began to settle down, and within half a minute 
        she was gone. I was thrown I suppose, well I was 180 foot up you understand, 
        and I was thrown well clear of the ship, otherwise I would have been sucked 
        under. </p>
