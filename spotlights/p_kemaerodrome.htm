      <br>
      The RAF unit that was despatched to support the North Russian Expeditionary 
      Force in May 1919 undertook various reconnaissance and bombing missions 
      against Bolshevik forces in the region. It also took a series of photographs 
      intended 'to give an impression of the work of the Unit and... the local 
      conditions and people'. The three photographs here show Bolshevik prisoners 
      (guarded by a Serbian officer) at work at the unit's headquarters, men from 
      the unit attempting to salvage the fuselage of a damaged aeroplane from 
      a lake, and an officer's inspection of men from the unit (with 'White' Russian 
      officers also present).<br>
