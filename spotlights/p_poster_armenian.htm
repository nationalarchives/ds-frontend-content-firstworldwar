      <br>
      The plight of the Armenian population was taken up by a number of charitable 
      and fund-raising organisations in the USA during the First World War. This 
      poster was issued by the American Committee for Relief in the Near East, 
      which was attempting to raise $30 million for victims of the war in Armenia, 
      Greece, Syria and Persia. It was designed by the Polish-born, New York-based 
      mural painter and illustrator Wladyslaw Benda, who became famous after the 
      war as a maker of masks.<br>
