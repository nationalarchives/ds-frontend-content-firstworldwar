      service made on behalf of Douglas Merry, 25 July 1918. <br>
      <br>
      Many of those who applied for exemption from compulsory military service 
      were not conscientious objectors. The appeal made by Douglas Merry, a 30-year-old 
      wine shop manager in Finchley, was based largely on economic grounds. According 
      to the wine shop owner, Frank Snell, Merry was the only person left capable 
      of running the business, as his own son was serving at the front. The tribunal 
      judging his case extended Merry's exemption by a further four months, on 
      the proviso that he continued his volunteer work as a 'special constable' 
      and with the fire brigade.<br>
