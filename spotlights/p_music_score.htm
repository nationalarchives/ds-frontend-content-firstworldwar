      'secret writing' about the British war effort, 1915.<br>
      <br>
      In July 1915, British censors intercepted four sheets of music being sent 
      to Norway. It was discovered that they contained 'secret writing' giving 
      detailed information about various aspects of the British war effort, such 
      as strikes, conscription and possible military targets for German aircraft. 
      This extract shows the letter writer, who signed himself 'Cecil', asking 
      his paymasters for more money so that he could gain information from his 
      brother about '[Royal] Navy movements'. In October 1915, 'Cecil', whose 
      real name was Courtenay de Rysbach, was sentenced to life imprisonment for 
      his espionage activities.<br>
