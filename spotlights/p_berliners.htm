      Although Germany signed an armistice with the Allies on 11 November 1918, 
      the trade blockade was maintained - at France's insistence - until the new 
      German republic signed peace terms in Paris at the end of June 1919. This 
      picture was probably taken in January 1919 during the Spartacist uprising, 
      an abortive Communist uprising in Berlin that led to fierce fighting between 
      government troops and revolutionaries. It illustrates starkly the widespread 
      hunger in the city at this time, as women and children hack away pieces 
      of meat from a horse killed in the fighting.<br>
