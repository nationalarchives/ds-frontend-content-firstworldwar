      now in the course of being established by Irishmen in Arms.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Republican 
      forces hold the lines taken up at Twelve noon on Easter Monday, and nowhere, 
      despite fierce and almost continuous attacks of the British troops, have 
      lines been broken through. The country is rising in answer to Dublin's call, 
      and the final achievement of Ireland's freedom is now, with God's help, 
      only a matter of days. The valour, self-sacrifice, and discipline of Irish 
      men and women are about to win our country a glorious place among the nations.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ireland's honour 
      has already been redeemed; it remains to vindicate her wisdom and her self-control.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All citizens 
      of Dublin who believe in the right of their Country to be free will give 
      their allegiance and their loyal help to the Irish Republic. There is work 
      for everyone: for the men in the fighting line, and for the women in the 
      provision of food and first aid. Every Irishman and Irishwoman worthy of 
      the name will come forward to help their common country in this her supreme 
      hour.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Able-bodies 
      Citizens can help by building barricades in the streets to oppose the advance 
      of the British troops. The British troops have been firing on our women 
      and on our Red Cross. On the other hand, Irish Regiments in the British 
      Army have refused to act against their fellow countrymen.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Provisional 
      Government hopes that its supporters - which means the vast bulk of the 
      people of Dublin - will preserve order and self-restraint. Such looting 
      as has already occurred has been done by hangers-on of the British Army. 
      Ireland must keep her new honour unsmirched.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have 
      lived to see an Irish Republic proclaimed. May we live to establish it firmly, 
      and may our children and our children's children enjoy the happiness and 
      prosperity which freedom will bring.<br>
