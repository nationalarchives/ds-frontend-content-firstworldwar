      Sir, <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present 
      grave emergency the War Office looks with the utmost confidence to you for 
      a continuance of the invaluable help which you have given in the past.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore 
      desire to invite your co- operation in the work of raising the additional 
      number of regular troops required at once for the army.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is intended 
      to enlist as soon as possible 100,000 men, and I would ask you to use your 
      great local influence and that of the Territorial Associations to secure 
      these necessary recruits as soon as possible.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men will 
      be accommodated in camps established at or near the existing regular depots 
      to which intending recruits may be sent, the camp nearest the place from 
      which they are drawn being selected.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No responsibility 
      for clothing or equipping the men will devolve upon County Associations; 
      this will be arranged by the military authorities.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the 
      Territorial Force may be enlisted, provided they fulfil the prescribed conditions 
      as to age and physical fitness.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Territorial 
      Force units that are at full strength will not recruit additional men until 
      the 100,000 men are provided, but should any of their numbers desire to 
      join the regular forces now being raised, their place in the Territorial 
      unit should be filled as soon as possible by men desirous of joining the 
      Territorial Force only, and not the regular army.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Territorial 
      units available for foreign service will naturally not be affected by this 
      recruiting of regular troops.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such is the 
      general outline of the scheme, in the furtherance of which you are desired 
      to co-operate as far as possible.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not an 
      ordinary appeal from the Army for recruits, but the formation of a second 
      army, and it is hoped that you will be able to assist in getting the men 
      in every way in your power.<br>
