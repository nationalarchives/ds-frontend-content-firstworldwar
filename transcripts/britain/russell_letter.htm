      <p>12 August 1918.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dear Frank 
        - I wish you to know exactly the reasons why I am anxious to be released 
        as soon as possible. My reasons are not only, or even principally, that 
        prison is disagreeable, though it is not, of course, a place of residence 
        that one would choose for pleasure. My principal reason is that I have 
        ideas for what I believe to be a really important piece of philosophical 
        research, with which I am exceedingly anxious to make progress; but in 
        spite of my utmost efforts I find it very hard to accomplish much while 
        I remain here. During my first two months of imprisonment I did a great 
        deal of work, as appeared from the MSS I sent out. But at the end of that 
        time I had a series of bad headaches, which obliged me to be careful; 
        &amp; ever since I have found that I cannot work much without a return 
        of the headaches, &amp; that the work I can do is not very fruitful. Philosophical 
        research is not like the work of a clerk or a housemaid: diligence alone 
        is not enough to ensure success in it. One needs also that condition of 
        mind &amp; body in which new ideas come; &amp; for that, diligence, though 
        necessary, is not sufficient. I have been reluctantly forced to the conclusion 
        that I shall not make much further progress with my work until I have 
        had a holiday in country air &amp; a chance to acquire more freshness 
        than is to be found in a prison cell. I am sorry it is so, as I desire 
        intensely to develop the ideas I have. Either Dr Whitehead or Professor 
        Carr, to whom I spoke about them, will, I feel sure, confirm me in saying 
        that these ideas are not unimportant, &amp; that it is a pity they should 
        not be worked out.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may remember 
        that the chairman of the Quarter Sessions, in assigning me to the First 
        Division, said that it would be a national misfortune if my philosophical 
        work were interfered with. He was obviously humane &amp; enlightened, 
        but without experience of either prison or research. I feel convinced, 
        from the way in which he spoke, that, if he knew the present state of 
        affairs, he would favour my release. Apart from the question of physical 
        fitness, I am seriously hampered by not having access to a library &amp; 
        by not being able to discuss philosophical questions except rarely &amp; 
        briefly. If you will consult any philosopher of your acquaintance, he 
        will tell you that, although I ought to be able to work in prison, he 
        himself, being of a peculiarly sensitive disposition, would be quite unable 
        to do so. And the fact is that peculiarities of this kind are usual among 
        those who have any capacity for original thought.<br>
