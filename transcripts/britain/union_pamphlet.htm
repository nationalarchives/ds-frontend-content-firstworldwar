      This country is at war, and has for the moment one over-whelming preoccupation: 
      to render safe our national inheritance.<br>
      The Union of Democratic Control has been founded for the purpose of trying 
      to secure for ourselves and the generations that succeed us a new course 
      of policy which will prevent a similar peril ever befalling our Empire. 
      Many men and women have already joined us holding varying shades of opinion 
      as to the origins of the war. Some think it was inevitable, some that it 
      could and should have been avoided. But we believe that all are in general 
      agreement about two things: First, it is imperative, that the war, once 
      begun, should be prosecuted to a victory for our country. Secondly, it is 
      equally imperative, while we carry on the war, to prepare for peace. Hard 
      thinking, free discussion, the open exchange of opinion and information 
      are the duty of all citizens to-day, if we are to have any hope that this 
      war will not be what most wars of the past have been - merely the prelude 
      to other wars.<br>
      Our contribution to this necessary discussion are the principles put forward 
      for consideration by the Union of Democratic Control. 
      <p> The Union of Democratic Control has been created to insist that the 
        following policy shall inspire the actual conditions of peace, and shall 
        dominate the situation after peace has been declared: -</p>

            <p>1. No Province shall be transferred from one Government to another 
              without consent by plebiscite of the population of such Province.</p>
            <p>2. No Treaty, Arrangement, or Undertaking shall be entered upon 
              in the name of Great Britain without the sanction of Parliament. 
              Adequate machinery for ensuring democratic control of foreign policy 
              shall be created.</p>
            <p>3. The Foreign Policy of Great Britain shall not be aimed at creating 
              Alliances for the purpose of maintaining the &quot;Balance of Power&quot;; 
              but shall be directed to the establishment of a Concert of Europe 
              and the setting up of an International Council whose deliberations 
              and decisions shall be public. </p>
            <p>4. Great Britain shall propose as part of the Peace settlement 
              a plan for the drastic reduction by consent of the armaments of 
              all the belligerent Powers, and to facilitate that policy shall 
              attempt to secure the general nationalisation of the manufacture 
              of armaments, and the control of the export of armaments by one 
              country to<span class="indent"> </span>another.</p>
