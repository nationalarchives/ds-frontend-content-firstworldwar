      <span class="texttranscript"><i>Riots.</i> - The Viceroy reported to the 
      India Office by telegrams dated April 11th and 13th that grave disorders 
      had occurred in various parts of India. It was anticipated that some outbreak 
      would result about April 6th, which had been set apart as a day of &quot;humiliation 
      and prayer&quot; in protest against the Rowlatt Bills by the extremist society 
      known as the Satyagraha Sabha (<em>see</em> below). Little disturbance, 
      however, occurred on that day, which, the Viceroy's reports show, passed 
      quietly in most places, though there were many meetings and demonstrations. 
      It was not till the 10th or 11th that the news of serious rioting, accompanied 
      by loss of life, was received. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trouble 
      occurred principally in the Punjab, particularly at Amritsar, the sacred 
      city of the Sikhs, and in Bombay Presidency at Ahmedabad, the second city 
      of the Presidency. The mobs burned banks, Government buildings and railway 
      premises. They also cut telegraph wires, and at Amritsar they burned to 
      death three bank managers.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Troops were 
      called in to restore order, and there were casualties on both sides. In 
      the Punjab five Europeans were killed and nine rioters, while 21 were wounded. 
      At Kasur one British soldier was killed and one wounded, and from Ahmedabad 
      &quot;slight loss of life&quot; is reported.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest information 
      is to the effect that order has been restored in the areas of disturbance. 
      <br>
      <br>
      <i>Day of Humiliation and Prayer. &#8211; </i>In an earlier communication 
      the Government of India reported that a manifesto ordaining that Sunday, 
      April 6th, should be observed as a day of humiliation and prayer had been 
      issued in Bombay by a society known as the Satyagraha Sabha.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manifesto 
      stated that owing to the Delhi tragedy demonstrators had been enjoined that 
      there should be no talking and no noise, and that absolute silence should 
      prevail. No pressure of any kind whatsoever should be put on those who do 
      not fast or suspend work, and those not participating in the national mourning 
      should be left absolutely undisturbed. Persons taking part in the demonstration 
      were asked to obey all police instructions.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Delhi Riots.</i> - The Government of India have telegraphed to the Secretary 
      of State the text of a communiqu&eacute; issued by them in India with the 
      object of contradicting certain misrepresentations which have been spread. 
      The communiqu&eacute; is as follows:-<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is reason 
      to believe that misleading accounts of the effects of the Anarchical and 
      Revolutionary Crimes Act, commonly known as the Rowlatt Bills, are being 
      circulated among the more ignorant sections of the population.</span> <span class="texttranscript"><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus in Delhi it 
      is reported that large sections of the populace believe that the Act empowers 
      any police officer to arrest without warrant any three Indians seen engaged 
      in conversation and to enter and search without warrant any house. These 
      beliefs, sedulously propagated by evilly disposed persons, and allowed to 
      pass uncontradicted by others, doubtless account largely for the high state 
      of excitement prevalent among the crowds that came in conflict with the 
      police and military at Delhi on March 30th with fatal results.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hardly 
      necessary to state that the Act contains no provisions of the nature indicated. 
      It confers no powers of arbitrary arrest or search on the police, and the 
      only reference which it contains to arrest or search is in section 34 (1), 
      which authorises the arrest on the written order of a local government of 
      any person where reasonable grounds exist for believing that he has been, 
      or is, concerned in certain serious offences in any area to which Part 3 
      of the Act has been extended. The same section permits the search under 
      similar authority of any place in such area believed to have been used by 
      such person for any purpose connected with an anarchical or revolutionary 
      movement.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No part of the 
      Act is yet in force, nor can any part be brought into force in any province 
      or area unless and until the Governor-General of India in Council is satisfied 
      that an anarchical or revolutionary movement is being promoted in such province 
      or area. </span> <p> <i>Famine.</i> - The Government of India in a telegram 
        to the India Office dated April 11th stated that famine had been declared 
        in Baghelkhand Agency, Central India.<br>
