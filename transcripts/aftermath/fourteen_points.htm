      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 
        regard to these essential rectifications of wrong and assertions of right, 
        we feel ourselves to be intimate partners of all the Governments and peoples 
        associated together against the Imperialists. We cannot be separated in 
        interest or divided in purpose. We stand together until the end.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For 
        such arrangements and covenants we are willing to fight and to continue 
        to fight until they are achieved; but only because we wish the right to 
        prevail, and desire a just and stable peace such as can be secured only 
        by removing the chief provocations to war, which this programme does remove. 
        We have no jealousy of German greatness, and there is nothing in this 
        programme that impairs it. We grudge her no achievement or distinction 
        of learning or of pacific enterprise such as have made her record very 
        bright and very enviable. We do not wish to injure her or to block in 
        any way her legitimate influence or power. We do not wish to fight her 
        either with arms or with hostile arrangements of trade if she is willing 
        to associate herself with us and the other peace-loving nations of the 
        world in covenants of justice and law and fair dealing. We wish her only 
        to accept a place of equality among the peoples of the world - the 
        new world in which we now live - instead of a place of mastery.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither 
        do we presume to suggest to her any alteration or modifications of her 
        institutions. But it is necessary, we must frankly say, and necessary 
        as a preliminary to any intelligent dealings with her on our part, that 
        we should know whom her spokesmen speak for when they speak to us, whether 
        for the Reichstag majority, or for the military party and the men whose 
        creed is imperial domination.</p>
