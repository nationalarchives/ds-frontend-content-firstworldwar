            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The successes

            a striking demonstration of the potentialities of air forces acting

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am convinced

            present time, when political and financial considerations require 
            that British commitments in the East shall be brought under careful

      <p align="center" class="texttranscript"><i>Note by the Chief of the Air 
        Staff.</i></p>
      <p align="left" class="texttranscript">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AT 
        a time when important decisions may be taken in matters of military policy, 
        the Air Staff desire to place on record in the briefest form the progress 
        made in the use of air power in Iraq.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early in 1920 
        it was clear to the Government that the military occupation of Iraq was 
        costing more in men and money that the country could afford, and it was 
        necessary to find some cheaper form of control or to evacuate the country. 
        In these circumstances, the then Secretary of State for Air (Mr. Churchill) 
        directed an examination of the possibility of making a greater use of 
        the Air Force. The Air Staff's proposals for the adoption of air power 
        as the main striking force in supersession of active operations by land 
        forces were accordingly submitted to the Committee of Imperial Defence 
        in March 1920. In March 1921, at a conference held in Cairo, an agreement 
        was reached, and in August 1921 the Cabinet sanctioned a scheme embodying 
        the principle of air control. Under this scheme the ground forces were 
        to be gradually reduced and the number of air squadrons increased, until 
        in October 1922 the Air Officer Commanding should assume command of all 
        forces, both military and air, in Iraq. It was stated by Mr. Churchill 
        in Parliament that the estimated saving on the adoption of this scheme 
        should amount to over 10 million sterling per annum.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actual experience 
        in the use of air forces for active operations in place of land columns 
        was gained throughout 1921. During this year regular military forces were 
        not employed in field operations and the Air Force was used under military 
        control with, on the whole, very satisfactory results, both the High Commissioner 
        and the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief agreeing that it had proved 
        its powers in several crises, and that the state of Iraq was satisfactory.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early in 1922, 
        however, Turkish activity increased on the Kurdistan frontier, and though 
        the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief was enabled to check this activity 
        to a very great extent by his use of air forces, there were still elements 
        in the situation which led the Air Staff to think that aerial action had 
        not achieved the full results of which they believed it capable. For example, 
        the Turks were still in occupation of Rowanduz, there was in January 1922 
        an instance of a Levy Force being exposed unduly to the attack of tribesmen, 
        and finally, in August 1922, there was the use of a column of regular 
        troops in the Rania district - a policy regarding which some misgivings 
        were felt.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this last 
        occasion in particular the Air Staff considered (and their opinion has 
        since been confirmed by the report of the local political officer) that 
        full advantage was not taken of the rapidity with which air forces can 
        be brought into action, but they recognised the difficulty which the soldier 
        must experience in placing primary reliance on a novel weapon with the 
        independent use of which he is comparatively unfamiliar. In the case of 
        a military commander, there must always be a natural tendency to make 
        use of troops if they are available. It was for this reason that the stipulation 
        was made in the original scheme for air control of Iraq that the officer 
        in command must be an air officer, who by reason of his training and trend 
        of mind would place almost exclusive reliance on air power, for on this 
        alone the feasibility of the scheme of defence depended. It was always, 
        therefore, their belief that with the assumption of control on the 1st 
        October, 1922, of the forces in Iraq by Air Vice-Marshal Sir John Salmond, 
        an even better use would be made of air forces. This belief has received 
        rapid confirmation. In a telegram dated the 21st October, 1922, the High 
        Commissioner for Iraq reports as follows:-</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p class="texttranscript">&quot;At the present moment Turkish elements 
          have withdrawn from practically every place to which they had penetrated 
          (including, it is reported, Rowanduz), and there are signs that a complete 
          withdrawal is in progress. <em>This withdrawal is due to remarkable 
          effect which has been achieved by vigorous and sustained air audacity 
          which has been in progress for the last few weeks</em>. That no order 
          to withdraw has been received is indicated by fact that on the 17th 
          October Commander of Rowanduz Garrison was in Qala Diza holding conference 
          at Pizhder leaders. Qala Diza was bombed the same date, and Euzdemir 
          withdrew. <em>Turks have been driven by air action alone</em>, <strong>unsupported 
          by land forces</strong>, <em>from districts Koi Sanjak, Rania, Qala 
          Diza and Bira Kapra in the north</em>. Reoccupation of Koi Sanjak by 
          Political Officer and Police without any opposition was entirely due 
          to previous aerial action, and the general situation as regards Turkish 
          aggression, which had given rise to considerable anxiety, is now to 
          a large extent restored. <em>I am emphasising at this early date, after 
          change of command, remarkable success which has attended a free and 
          vigorous use of our aerial resources because I consider it of importance 
          that the Turks should not be allowed to claim any credit for a withdrawal 
          which has been forced upon them</em>.&quot;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p class="texttranscript">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
        question of the retention or partial evacuation of our present positions 
        in Iraq is a matter of policy for the decision of the Government, but 
        it is the duty of the Air Staff to bring to notice the military aspects 
        of the situation. In their view, this latest proof of the power of air 
        forces establishes the fact that their retention in Baghdad will be accompanied 
        by no appreciable military risk, for if air forces can effect such great 
        results in the hilly districts of Kurdistan at a distance from their bases, 
        there should be no reason to doubt their power to break up any attack 
        on Baghdad, <em>except in the event of organised external aggression on 
        a large scale</em>. The progress made towards agreement with Turkey suggests 
        that there will be little or no danger from this source in the future. 
        With Baghdad and Basra held, we can fulfil any promise to which we may 
        be committed in the matter of support of the Government of Iraq, and the 
        administration of outlying districts can proceed (as was originally stated 
        in the Air Scheme) as fast or as slowly as circumstances may dictate. 
        <em>At the same time, in Baghdad and Basra we shall be controlling two 
        most important points in the chain of Imperial communications</em>.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air power 
        is of vital concern to the Empire, and in Iraq, under the control of an 
        air officer, further evidence is accumulating of its great potentialities. 
        A continued demonstration, until its effectiveness is beyond dispute, 
        may have far-reaching results, in that it may lead to still further economies 
        in defence expenditure, not only in Iraq, but also in other Eastern territories 
        where armed forces are required to give effect to British policy and uphold 
        British prestige.</p>
