        arraign William II of Hohenzollern, formerly German Emperor, for a supreme 
        offence against international morality and the sanctity of treaties.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A special 
        tribunal will be constituted to try the accused, thereby assuring him 
        the guarantees essential to the right of defence. It will be composed 
        of five judges, one appointed to the right of defence. It will be composed 
        of five judges, one appointed by each of the following Powers: namely, 
        the United States of America, Great Britain, France, Italy and Japan.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its decision 
        the tribunal will be guided by the highest motives of international policy, 
        with a view to vindicating the solemn obligations of international undertakings 
        and the validity of international morality. It will be its duty to fix 
        the punishment which it considers should be imposed.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Allied 
        and Associated Powers will address a request to the Government of the 
        Netherlands for the surrender to them of the ex-Emperor in order that 
        he may be put on trial. </span> </p>

        acts in violation of the laws and customs of war. Such persons shall, 
        if found guilty, be sentenced to punishments laid down by law. This provision
