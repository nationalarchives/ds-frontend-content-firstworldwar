        The following extract is taken from a Report (G.T. 6603) circulated by 
        the Home Secretary.<br>
        </b></span></p>
      <br>
      <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="texttranscript">The 
      Progress of Bolshevism.</span></i> <span class="texttranscript">- (1) <i>Germany.</i> 
      - The present position appears to be that the Spartacus Group has succeeded 
      in seizing the executive power in Berlin. It was already predominant in 
      Hamburg, Kiel and Bremen. How far Bolshevist principles will radiate from 
      Berlin no one can foretell, but it is difficult to believe that there will 
      not be a reaction in South Germany and the Rhine Provinces, or that the 
      German people as a whole, with their love of organisation and good order, 
      will tamely submit to a Bolshevist regime on the Russian plan. At the present 
      moment the prospect of having a stable Central Government to deal with in 
      the Peace negotiations is not good.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is undoubted 
      evidence to show that a systematic attempt to corrupt the morale of the 
      Allied troops in occupation is being made. The German Legations in Copenhagen, 
      The Hague, and Berne have been left untouched, both in personnel and in 
      policy. They appear to think that their best chance of saving something 
      from the wreck is to provoke Bolshevist disturbances in the Allied countries, 
      and to this end they are printing leaflets and employing returned prisoners 
      as agents to go among the troops and incite them to depose their officers. 
      Agents have also been taken on for service in England and France. They are 
      especially active among the American troops of occupation, and it is perhaps 
      significant that a considerable number of Americans are reported to have 
      deserted into Germany. These may perhaps be merely men who are determined 
      to escape from military discipline at all hazards and who have taken the 
      line of least resistance in the hopes of securing a passage home to America.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the 
      German source of propaganda, there is another stream flowing from Russia. 
      These agents are for the most part returned prisoners of war, well supplied 
      with money and passes and leaflets on Bolshevist principles. The chief Bolshevist 
      organ for propaganda is the <i>Velt Revolution</i>, published weekly in 
      several languages under the auspices of the International Federation; the 
      editor of the edition in English is Philips Price, formerly correspondent 
      of the <i>Manchester Guardian.</i><br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The munition 
      works are still busy for eight hours a day, the hands working four hours 
      and loafing four hours. For the last four hours they are paid 75 per cent. 
      of their ordinary wage. The general impression in Berlin is that the return 
      of the troops will at first strengthen the forces of order, but that if 
      they remain in Berlin they will become infected with Bolshevism; at present 
      they show no tendencies in that direction. </span> 
      <p> <span class="texttranscript">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)<i> 
        Denmark.</i> - The attempt of the Syndicalists to bring about a general 
        strike on November 13th having failed, the Social Democratic Party has 
        issued a programme of reforms, and has, through its organ <i>The Social 
        Democrat,</i> called upon the working classes to remain orderly. There 
        is no immediate danger of a Bolshevist disturbance in that country.</span></p>
      <p class="texttranscript">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) 
        <i>Switzerland.</i> - Revolutionary deserters in Zurich have already organised 
        a Spartacus Group, and are in communication with Haase and Liebknecht. 
        The German Consul has been instructed to give passes to those who are 
        willing to go to Berlin to serve under Haase.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government 
        enquiry into the recent disturbances has resulted in the determination 
        to expel 18 Bolshevists and 15 Italian anarchists.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of 
        Swiss Socialists are reported to believe that there is already disorder 
        in England. Generally speaking, they are not in favour of violence, believing 
        that propaganda among the peasants and workmen will be more effective.</p>
      <p class="texttranscript">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) 
        <i>France.</i> - Bolshevism does not appear to be making much progress 
        in France, in spite of the fact that Mosimann, chief of the Berne Police, 
        a Germanophile, is believed to be issuing false Swiss papers to agents 
        working for the Central Powers. An Italian deserter named Adolfo Sismondo 
        stated that while in Paris a few weeks ago he attended the Bolshevist 
        meeting at the Hotel Suisse, 5, Rue de la Huchette, convened for deciding 
        on the propitious moment for starting revolution in France and Italy. 
        The meeting was attended by 16 revolutionaries, including Charbri&egrave;res, 
        the proprietor of the Hotel Suisse, and Morgari, the Italian Socialist 
        Deputy, who visited England a few months ago. There was a difference of 
        opinion as to whether the move should be made on the signature of the 
        armistice or after the signature of peace, and the meeting showed that 
        there was distrust between the revolutionaries themselves.</p>
      <p class="texttranscript">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) 
        <i>Belgium.</i> - The morale of the Belgian population in the British 
        Army areas continues to be good. Feeling runs very high against those 
        who trafficked with the enemy during the occupation. There is a very strong 
        feeling against profiteering and the high price of food.</p>
      <p class="texttranscript">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)<i> 
        Spain. </i>- The Government proposes to send the Russian and Levantine 
        Bolshevists, now in Barcelona, to Odessa and Constantinople. Since they 
        have ceased to receive pay from the German Secret Service these men are 
        becoming desperate. In ordinary times they would simply be put across 
        the nearest frontier, but this, of course, is impossible at present.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unrest 
        in Spain is crystallising into the Separatist Catalan Movement, and many 
        well-informed Spaniards think that the Crown is not at present in any 
        real danger, though there will be sporadic disorders all over the country. 
        The Army and Civil Guard are believed at present to be faithful.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A spurious 
        anarchist body, now calling itself &quot;La Ligue Nationalists (<em>sic</em>) 
        Catalana,&quot; has reappeared in Paris. It was formed 15 years ago under 
        the name of &quot;La Ligue Catalana,&quot; and carried on a noisy agitation 
        in favour of Ferrer. During the war it was believed to be defunct, but 
        it has now become active again with a view to the Peace Conference, where 
        it hopes to obtain President Wilson's support as representing an oppressed 
        nationality like the Poles and the Irish.</p>
      <p class="texttranscript">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) 
        <i>Italy</i>. - The speedy and friendly settlement of the metal workers' 
        strike at Milan has relieved the tension in Northern Italy, and for the 
        moment Bolshevism is making no progress. The worst feature is the bad 
        management of the demobilisation, especially in regard to returned prisoners 
        of war, who are said to be wandering about, sleeping out and stealing 
        or begging their food.</p>
      <p class="texttranscript">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest 
        attaches to an interview given to the Warsaw Correspondent of the Associated 
        Press by M. Paderewski (published in <em>The Times</em> of January 9th). 
        M. Paderewski declared that Bolshevism must be destroyed and drew attention 
        to Poland's r&ocirc;le as a barrier State against Bolshevist encroachments.</p>
