            pumping is being carried on by volunteers (such as colliery officials) 
            and naval ratings. Sir Eric Geddes is arranging to meet Mr. Herbert 
            Smith to discuss the return of the proper pump hands to duty; and 
            winding enginemen and pump-men of three colleries (<i>sic</i>) have 
            resumed work to-day. The total number of naval ratings now employed 
            is 158; and it is reported that winding enginemen and pump-men are 
            contemplating a return to work in several districts to prevent naval 
            ratings being sent. Six pits are flooded, and it is expected that 
            four others will be flooded in the course of to-day. The hardship 
            caused by the Coal Strike is increased by a Strike of the Co-operative
