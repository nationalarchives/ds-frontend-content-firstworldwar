      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="texttranscript">The 
      country between the Hejaz Railway and AZRAK is practically featureless. 
      It consists of quite barren desert, in which the valleys first run S.W., 
      but after about 20 miles E. of the Railway, N.E., among rounded hills of 
      limestone and brown flint. Some of the higher hills have rude cairns on 
      the top, but none rise more than 200 feet above the surrounding country, 
      and few of them will be distinguishable from the air. It would be possible 
      to land in most of this area, but very difficult to get off again.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Near AZRAK the 
      country flattens out. About KHARANEH, about AMRUH, and about KASR EL WEINID, 
      the valleys are sometimes several miles in breadth, with low banks, and 
      scrub-filled bottoms, through which the winter floods have cut treacherous 
      little channels a yard or two wide, and perhaps two feet deep. Whenever 
      possible a forced landing should be made on a patch of bare mud, or on the 
      back of a flint slope, in preference to a wadi. KHARANEH, AMRUH and WEINID 
      are large ruined hunting-palaces of the Ghassanide kings.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lava fields, 
      usually raised 20 feet above the ordinary level of the country, and appearing 
      in colour either grey or blue or black according to the weather conditions, 
      lie to the north of AMRUH and flank the west bank of the great group of 
      valleys that come up from the south - the GHADAF - into AZRAK.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lava fields 
      resemble shingle beaches, with the pebbles made angular, and enlarged to 
      a foot or two in length. Landing in lava fields is impossible. Their tops, 
      however, frequently contain bright yellow mud flats, where the driven sand 
      and dust have settled and been watered out by floods into areas as flat 
      as tennis courts, and harder. If large enough these make ideal landing grounds, 
      (and if possible one of these lying S.W. of AZRAK will be chosen as such 
      when required).<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AZRAK itself 
      is fairly obvious when reached, for it is marked by a lagoon of fresh water, 
      which, according to season, is an open stretch a mile long fringed with 
      green lawns, or a dense brake of bull-rushes and water-canes. From its brilliant 
      greenness it will stand out for many miles and should make AZRAK unmistakable. 
      The place itself is a grove of 60 palm trees, with the square court-yard 
      and corner towers of a fort that began as Roman, was adapted by the Ghassanide 
      kings as a desert outpost, restored by the first Mohammedans and garrisoned 
      by successive Sultans of Damascus as a protection against the Beduin. It 
      lies a stone's throw from the lake, is built of black basalt, and is about 
      100 yards square. Behind it, to West and North, is a belt of jagged lava, 
      from a mile to two miles wide, and North of that, rolling flint plains to 
      the outlying spurs of JEBEL DRUSE 12 miles away. To the N.E. the lava bed 
      is narrower, and beyond it lie the waste of sand-heaps, grown with Tamarisk, 
      that the Arabs call WADI SIRHAN.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AZRAK has no 
      other house, and only one permanent inhabitant, but, owing to its unceasing 
      water supply, it is much frequented by Beduin, who usually camp to the South 
      towards EL WEINID, between the lava fields and branches of the GHADAF.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the attached 
      sketch-map, the immediate neighbourhood of the Kasr - the fort - is 
      shown not inaccurately. The complex of valleys between AMRUH and AZRAK is 
      not attempted, nor are the areas or extent of the lava fields correctly 
      shown. </span>
