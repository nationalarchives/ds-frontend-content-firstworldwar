      <blockquote> 
        <p><span class="texttranscript">Following message received from General 
          Cadorna :-</span></p>
        <p><span class="texttranscript"> "The successful development of Russian 
          offensive justifies suppositions foreseen by us that in near future 
          a situation similar to that which I foresaw in my telegram No. 2979 
          GM June 26th, (in which we asked France and England to supply 25 batteries 
          and 132000 rounds) may arise on the front of the Julian Alps. I may 
          state too that from information received and by direct observation of 
          movements behind the lines, the first symptoms of this are already visible. 
          Consequently the necessity of putting forward the date of the offensive 
          as much as possible is evident and on the other hand on account of our 
          munitions crisis which the recent help from France and England reduced 
          but did not solve it seems as if the offensive in question cannot be 
          begun before the end of August. In my telegram quoted above I have already 
          shown you that 100 guns with 1000 rounds each are absolutely necessary 
          to make up deficiency of munitions. But if General Petain cannot spare 
          the batteries which have been asked for and considers they can be better 
          employed on the Franco-British front I must point out the serious consequences 
          which the common cause of the Allies may suffer by not taking advantage 
          of the particularly favourable strategical situation now developing 
          on the front of the Julian Alps and by giving up the advantages of a 
          simultaneous attack with necessary means on both Austrian fronts. In 
          any case if decision of the General Staff is irrevocable kindly communicate 
          above message to General Foch and ask him to use his influence with 
          General Robertson to accept responsibility for finding at least part 
          of batteries which we have asked for and to the supplying of which to 
          my certain knowledge the British Government is in favour of." </span></p>
        <p><span class="texttranscript">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 
          account of result already obtained by Russian offensive and of declaration 
          of General Brousiloff that this is the only offensive which he is able 
          to make this year, it seems of the highest importance to me that the 
          Italian offensive should take place during first days of August and 
          that General Cadorna should at least receive part of the batteries asked 
          for by him. He must not be given a reason whether real or otherwise 
          not to attack at the right moment.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is 
          now agreed to by General Petain who has put at my disposal for immediate 
          conveyance to Italy 6 batteries, 155 C Schneider, 6 mortars calibre 
          237, 4 mortars calibre 370, total 34 guns.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important, 
          if you approve, that you should send without delay to General Cadorna 
          the batteries asked for by him through my medium, after interview at 
          St. Jean De Maurienne. Ends. </span></p>
