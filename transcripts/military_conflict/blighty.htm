          <td valign="top"><strong>OUR MESSAGE. </strong> &nbsp; To you, old readers, 
            you boys who are doing the fighting for us on land and sea, we have 
            nothing much to say beyond wishing you good luck and God speed this 
            Christmas time - and come home safe to us, because we love you. 
            Thank you many times and very heartily for the hundreds of sketches 
            and stories and jokes you have sent us, and your thousands of kind 
            messages, telling us that you like BLIGHTY, and think it good reading. 
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have 
            been saving up your best writings and drawings for some time, just 
            for this Christmas Number, and you have the result in these pages, 
            practically all filled with the work of men on active service. Some 
            of the sketches have been redrawn, because they could not be reproduced 
            for printing in the form in which they reached us: a drawing faintly 
            done in pencil on a bit of smudgy paper cannot be &quot;processed&quot; 
            satisfactorily. <br>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You 
              will notice that this number is marked &quot;6d&quot;; that does 
              not apply<br>
              to the hundred thousand copies which we send to you, as usual, with 
              our best wishes. But this particular issue will be offered for sale 
              at home, to raise funds for the future free publication of the paper 
              in the New Year, and until the war is won by you. That's all. God 
              bless you!<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To you, 
              our new readers, who buy this number - the first copies of 
              BLIGHTY ever offered for sale - we want to tell the story of 
              how the paper came into existence. Two boys, one a sailor and one 
              a soldier, wrote home to their father, a journalist, each asking 
              for &quot;something to read.&quot; The supply of books and papers 
              for the Fleet and Front had fallen off because of the scarcity of 
              paper.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
              father said to another newspaper man, &quot;Wouldn't it be a great 
              idea to cut out all the best pictures and stories out of all the 
              best papers, and reprint them in one paper, which would contain 
              the cream of them all?&quot; It was agreed: a committee of journalists 
              was formed: one of them lent an office, and they raised enough money 
              to send out a few thousand circulars asking for funds.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
              public responded generously: Lord French, Sir John Jellicoe, and 
              Sir David Beatty became patrons: the newspaper proprietors kindly 
              consented to let their matter be reprinted. The War Office and the 
              Admiralty agreed to take copies and send them out; the Y.M.C.A. 
              the Red Cross Society, and other good friends helped, and the first 
              number of BLIGHTY was published on May 31st.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six 
              months have passed, and BLIGHTY has won &quot;golden opinions from 
              all sorts of people.&quot; Sir Douglas Haig has been good enough 
              to become one of our patrons, and to tell us &quot;how much he appreciates 
              the great kindness your Committee and supporters are showing to 
              the troops under his command.&quot; We have had nice things said 
              to us by bishops and clergymen, admirals and generals, great ladies 
              and the wives and mothers of our readers.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What 
              we value most of all are the simple, grateful messages in which 
              the boys themselves thank us for the paper, and they made us ashamed, 
              because these dear fellows seem to think it a great thing we are 
              doing for them, and we know it is a very small thing, compared to 
              what they are doing for us.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope 
              to keep on &quot;doing our bit&quot; - the weekly production 
              of this little paper. It has sometimes been a bit of a struggle, 
              for paper is very dear, and the production of a hundred thousand 
              copies costs nearly four hundred pounds a week.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We offer 
              this Christmas Number for sale in order to get money to &quot;carry 
              on.&quot; Everyone who spends a sixpence on it is helping us, and 
              is invited to help still further as set forth on page 40.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our 
              thanks to all the good people who have helped - proprietors 
              and editors, artists and writers, subscribers and advertisers. They 
              have been doing things for the boys, and it is not the way of the 
              boys to take always and give nothing. So they have written and illustrated 
              this Christmas Number for the folks at home. They have jolly good 
              reason to be proud of their work, too, and it will be a souvenir 
              worth keeping.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
              so good-bye, new readers of the larger public, who will not be our 
              readers any more until some notable occasion calls for another special 
              issue. We hope it will be a Peace Number, and that it will be published 
              early in the New Year, for which our good wishes to you all.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P.S. 
              - Read page 40, and do not be afraid to act on it, because 
              no one is making money out of this paper, there are no profits, 
              and if any funds are left at the finish they will be given to a 
              war charity. </p>
