      <span class="texttranscript">Dear Miss Sternberg, </span> 
      <p class="handwritten"><span class="texttranscript">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks 
        ever so much for your delightfully long letter. As a rule I am a brute 
        about letter writing, but out here, things are so different. One is so 
        utterly glad to receive a letter, especially a long one, that the hope 
        of obtaining a return spurs one on to great efforts in letter writing.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can have 
        no idea how one looks for the post, and how disappointed one feels if 
        there is nothing for one: I can quite understand the 'lonely soldiers' 
        idea at which once I used to laugh.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason 
        is quite obvious. Picture to yourself our life here. There is an incessant 
        thudding of guns in the distance to concentrate one's mind on the beastly 
        shells. It becomes an obsession with some poor fellows who have been wounded, 
        or been </span><span class="strikethrough">in som</span><span class="texttranscript"> 
        through some hideous time in the trenches or the attack. The only antidote 
        is preoccupation of some other kind, something to take the mind off the 
        war. Well, what have we? Reading? A few papers now &amp; again! A game 
        of bridge sitting on the sides of ramshackle temporary beds, or on a soapbox! 
        All the side shows of civilisation are afar off, &amp; we live a most 
        primitive life, well fed it is true but in the style of a miner's cottage, 
        though much dirtier. The odds and ends of time between work are so hard 
        for the ordinary man to fill in. Of course it does not affect me quite 
        so much, as I have official permission to sketch. But the weather is not 
        always suitable, and then one sits in a tent trying to kill time. It is 
        fatal to go out in the wet more than is necessary, as there is no opportunity 
        of drying clothes, and putting on a clammy shirt &amp; breeches in the 
        morning is none too pleasant.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't mean 
        to be horrid when I said that you did not care for parsons. Strictly privately 
        there are heaps of good men amongst them, infinitely better than I am, 
        that I loathe, because of their clerical mannerism, and the damsel dear 
        to the vicar's heart who gushes over sermons, wears her placquet (?) hole 
        round on the offside, &amp; does her hair in a severe bob, has no attraction 
        for me.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other 
        day the doctor and I went out to gather blackberries to make what our 
        miner cook calls a pudden. It is one of the contrasts of war: overhead 
        balloons &amp; planes; the incessant thud and thunder of the evening strafe; 
        and the quiet hedge,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last time 
        over the bags was rather terrible. The few who managed to pull themselves 
        out of the waist deep mud had to stand on the top &amp; pull others who 
        were stuck out of the trenches. Imagine doing that with machine guns hard 
        at work, to say nothing of snipers. One man I know of was drowned in the 
        mud. Another was only extricated by eight men. Naturally no supports or 
        rations could come up, &amp; after gaining their objective in some cases, 
        in others being thrown down at once they had to retire.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have had 
        to make this trench too wide<br>
