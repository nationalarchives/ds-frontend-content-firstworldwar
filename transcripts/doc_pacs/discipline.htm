            looked upon as essential in all regular armies of the world. The death 
            sentence had been introduced at the front and in rear. The men were 
            not allowed to remove higher commanders at will. The powers of committees 
            were being restricted and confined purely to matters of interior economy. 
            There even seemed the possibility of removing the committees altogether

            on all previous orders which had been issued for the maintenance of 
            discipline being strictly enforced. The first point is worthy of notice, 
            namely &quot;To stop political conflicts amongst the troops.&quot; 
            If this order was enforced it would go far towards removing one of 
            the main causes of the present lack of discipline, namely the introduction 
            of politics into the Army. The whole trend of present affairs, however, 
            is working in the opposite direction, and the Army is becoming more 
            and more steeped in politics. This is not to be wondered at, as the 
            Army is at present the deciding factor in the political situation.</td>

            Alexeyev's resignation and the decision to introduce drastic reforms 
            in the Army.</td>
