            Gave Miss B fearful shocks by marching in on her yesterday, the committee 
            having decided that Farnboro couldn't do without me, &amp; wrote to 
            put me off. Anyway I never got their letter. So Miss B. went up to 
            London &amp; told them that I was very annoyed at being put off in 
            this way &amp; wouldn't go back to Farnboro', so I begin work as night 
            hand at Woolwich tonight 24 hours out of bed!</td>

            Wed. My first night duty. Quite enjoyed it though I felt very sleepy. 
            Boys come in &amp; out all the time to b[u]y buns, tea, lemonade etc 
            &amp; at 11.30 a big batch of girls come to dinner. It is much more 
            exciting than at Farnborough. Then there are a few men who come to 
            dinner, &amp; tea for the girls at 3.30am, tea for the boys at 4am, 
            5.30am more boys &amp; some men, so that we only have quiet between 
            12.30 - 3. when we scrub the tables &amp; have our own meal. We take 
            from &pound;4 to &pound;5 every night. As nearly all of it comes in 
            coppers it is pretty strenuous. The girls are very rough, regular 
            cockneys but mostly amiable if not rubbed the wrong way. If they are 
            it is Billingsgate gone mad. The only thing then is to give it them 
            hot &amp; they generally shut up after a bit. A good many come from 
            the danger buildings. When they arrive at their work they have to 
            take out all hairpins, &amp; must not wear metal buttons or hooks 
            &amp; eyes. They have to take off their own shoes on one side of the 
            shift room, &amp; jump over a barrier onto what is called the clean 
            side in their stockinged feet. There they put on danger shoes which 
            are soft &amp; have no treads. Their work is filling cartridges for 
            bombs</td>

            Woolwich is one huge slum, &amp; in fact there are slums all the way 
            between here &amp; London which is 1 1/2 hours by tram. But bits of 
            it are rather entertaining for all that. Beresford square outside 
            the main gate is alway[s] full of stalls &amp; barrows, fruit, vegetables, 
            fish, tripe, winkles, flowers, knives &amp; tools, live stock &amp; 
            all the various wares one sees at Petticoat Lane. There are also street 
            jugglers &amp; palmists. All along the road to the arsenal are queer 
            little shops including several whose trade is to take care of pipes 
            &amp; baccy while the owners are inside the arsenal at work. There 
            are five gates to the arsenal each about 1 1/2 miles beyond the other. 
            We go by tram from our digs to the third gate, after this we have 
            25 minutes sharp walking through the arsenal to reach our canteen. 
            The road is called <span class="strikethrough">as a rule</span> the 
            'Long Straight'. Imagine Oxford Street with no lights, no pavements 
            &amp; no islands &amp; intersected by railway lines every short distance. 
            It is in addition a sea of liquid mud. You leap out of the way of 
            a motor lorry &amp; land in front of a tram. You scuttle away from 
            this &amp; run into a navvy whose language becomes blue. The canteen 
            is close to the firing pits so that by day the noise is deafening, 
            cups leap off the shelves and every now &amp; then the windows break. 
            But I am spared this at night. The workmen who work in the further 
            parts of the factory go to work on the weirdest little trams with 
            wee little engines &amp; trucks like Irish jaunting cars. When 4 or 
            5 trucks are strung together it is most comic to see a long row of 
            men each with his red handkerchief on his knees sitting side by side 
            like a long row of swallows on a telegraph wire, or more like old 
            hens on a perch.</td>

              Today I was shown over the factory as a great favour. First I saw 
              cordite made into charges. Each charge consists of 5 or 6 little 
              bagsful &amp; a core. Each little bag is shaped like a lifebelt. 
              [<em>drawing on right</em>] The quantity of cordite it contains 
              has to be weighed to a pins head. Even the silk it is sewn up with 
              is weighed. Each bag contains a different weight, &amp; the five 
              or 6 are then threaded on the core. The core is made of a bundle 
              of cordite like a faggot. The whole charge is then packed in a box 
              with a detonator. <br>
              [<i>drawing on the right</i>] </p>
            <p>Then I was shown the lyddite works. This is a bright canary yellow 
              powder (picric acid) &amp; comes to the factory in wooden tubs. 
              It is then sifted. The house, (windows, doors, floor &amp; walls) 
              is bright yellow, &amp; so are the faces &amp; hands of all the 
              workers. As soon as you go in the powder in the air makes you sneeze 
              &amp; splutter &amp; gives you a horrid bitter taste at the back 
              of the throat. After sifting the acid is put in cans, &amp; stood 
              in tanks where it is boiled until it melts into a clear fluid like 
              vinegar. Then it is poured into the shell case. But a mould is put 
              in before it has time to solidify. This mould when drawn out leaves 
              a space down the middle of the shell. Before it is drawn out beeswax 
              is poured in, &amp; then several cardboard washers put in. [<i>drawing 
              below</i>] Then the mould is replaced by a candle shaped exploder 
              of TNT or some other very high explosive is put in.</p>
