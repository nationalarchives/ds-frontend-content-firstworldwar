            should be our foreign policy, speaking of course from a military point 
            of view ?</td>

        <tr> 
          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writing 
            as a simple soldier I would say that a foreign policy which ignored 
            strategy was no policy at all. It is axiomatic that policy and strategy 
            must walk hand in hand. That being so if we examine the map ( as we 
            were doing yesterday evening ) we can see the value to us and France 
            if Belgium is actively hostile to Germany. But as far as my knowledge 
            goes Belgium will remain passive and neutral if she possibly can even 
            if, and when, German armies over run all her country south of the 
            Meuse and Sambre. She will remain passive and neutral unless she is 
            convinced that we are going to join France and are determined to fight 
            this war out to a victorious finish. If Belgium believed this she 
            would join with us. And for this reason. She hates the idea of being 
            absorbed into the German Empire and she fears, and with good reason, 
            that even if she remains neutral she will as a matter of fact be swallowed 
            up by her big neighbour after the war is over if Germany is victorious. 
            On the other hand she knows that neither England nor France have any 
            designs on her independance and she would incline to them if she was 
            persuaded that they had determined on joint action. My opinion therefore 
            is that, for the single and specific case of an unwarranted attack 
            by Germany on France or an attempt by Germany to seize or absorb Belgium, 
            England and France should have an offensive and defensive alliance 
            and in this Belgium would join. Whether Holland could be induced to 
            join I am not sure nor do I much care. Denmark ought to be brought 
            into it and I take it for granted that Russia is already there.</td>

        <tr> 
          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Belgium, 
            hostile to Germany, would mean that the line of the Meuse was secure, 
            that the fortresses of Namur and Li&egrave;ge and the work at Huy 
            were impregnable. It would mean an open and friendly country for us 
            to operate in, it would therefore mean a constant and ever increasing 
            menace to the German right flank and the German line of communication; 
            and most important of all, it would mean that the superiority in German 
            numbers could not be brought into play.</td>

        <tr> 
          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hostile

            on the French frontier.</td>

            difference that such a state of affairs would make on our strategy 
            would be incalculable and, again writing as a soldier, I venture to 
            urge the vital importance to this country of policy and strategy being 
            worked in the most intimate connection and, in furtherance of this 
            aim, I would press with all the weight I possess for an (<i>circled</i>)offensive 
            and defensive alliance between ourselves, France, Belgium and, if 
            possible, Denmark.</td>
