            burnt down in both towns. The English colony returned to a small village 
            named Dembrowa, and were little troubled; one of the Englishmen of 
            the party was married to a Russian, and she proved most useful in

            the pass, and they could clear out the enemy at any time, but prefer 
            to continue the fighting in the mountains. The snow is breast deep

            wretchedly-clad Austrians are quite unfitted for warfare under such 
            conditions; hence the Russian tactics of failing to press the advantage

            - and the only way they have of beating the Germans is to advance 
            in overwhelming numbers in close formation. In this way they defeated 
            the Germans and Hungarians at Stanislaw, but, of course, lost heavily
