        to the Imperial Chancellor, <br>
        27 July 1914</b></p>
      <p>Military attach&eacute; reports discussion with War Minister: </p>
      <p>Sazonov asked the latter to inform me of the situation. The War Minister 
        gave me his word of honour that no mobilisation order has as yet been 
        issued. Provisional preparatory measures have been taken, but no reservist 
        has been called up and not one horse has been commandeered. If Austria 
        were to cross the Serbian border, those military districts directed against 
        Austria - Kiev, Odessa, Moscow, Kazan - would mobilise, whereas those 
        on the German front - Warsaw, Vilna, St. Petersburg - would not mobilise 
        under any circumstances. Peace with Germany is urgently desired. There 
        was a shrug in response to my question about the purpose of mobilisation 
        against Austria, and diplomacy was referred to. I told the minister that 
        the friendly intentions were valued here, but that mobilisation directed 
        at Austria alone could be regarded in itself as very threatening.</p>
