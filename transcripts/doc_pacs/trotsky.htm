      Mr Trotsky: </span> 
      <p>The task of this sub-commission, as we had understood it, was to give 
        us an answer to the question of the extent to which the new border suggested 
        by the opposition is suitable, even if only to secure to the smallest 
        degree the right of self-determination for the Russian people. We have 
        heard the report of our representatives in the commission and, after lengthy 
        negotiations and upon consideration of the issues from all necessary angles, 
        we are of the opinion that the critical hour has arrived. The nations 
        await with impatience the result of peace negotiations at Brest-Litovsk. 
        They ask themselves when there will be an end to humanity's unprecedented 
        self-destruction, brought about by the will to dominate and the greed 
        of the ruling classes of all countries.</p>
      <p>This war has long since ceased to be a defensive war for either side, 
        if indeed it ever was that. If England seizes hold of the African colonies, 
        Baghdad and Jerusalem, it is not a defensive war; and if Germany occupies 
        Belgium, Serbia, Romania, Poland and Lithuania and takes the Islands in 
        the Moorsund [The Sound], it is not a defensive war but a struggle for 
        the division of the world. This is now clearer than ever and we want no 
        more part in this purely imperialistic war, where the wishes of the land-owning 
        classes are quite openly paid for with the blood of the people. Our relationship 
        with the imperialistic governments of both sides is the same, and we are 
        no longer willing to shed our soldiers' blood for the interests of one 
        side over the other. We are leading our army and our people out of the 
        war in anticipation of the hopefully imminent time when the oppressed 
        peoples of all countries will take their fate into their own hands in 
        the way Russia's workers have done. Our former farm worker, present soldier, 
        must return to the land, which the Revolution took out of the hands of 
        the landowners and placed into peasant hands, so that he can till the 
        land peacefully this spring. Our industrial soldier must return to his 
        workshop to produce weapons of production, rather than weapons of destruction, 
        and together with the farmer build a new socialist economy.</p>
      <p>We hereby notify all peoples and their governments of our intention to 
        withdraw from the war. We issue the order to fully demobilise all armies 
        facing the armies of Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey. It 
        is our belief that other nations will soon follow our example. At the 
        same time, we declare that the conditions proposed to us by the governments 
        of Germany and Austria-Hungary are fundamentally inconsistent with the 
        interests of all peoples. The workers of all nations will reject these 
        conditions, including those of Austria-Hungary and German...</p> <br>
