        <tr> 
          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COUNT MENSDORFF told me by instruction 
            to-day that the Servian Government had not accepted the demands which 
            the Austrian Government were obliged to address to them in order to 
            secure permanently the most vital Austrian interest. Servia showed 
            that she did not intend to abandon her subversive aims, tending towards 
            continuous disorder in the Austrian frontier territories and their 
            final disruption from the Austrian Monarchy. Very reluctantly, and 
            against their wish, the Austrian Government were compelled to take 
            more severe measures to enforce a fundamental change of the attitude 
            of enmity pursued up to now by Servia. As the British Government knew, 
            the Austrian Government had for many years endeavoured to find a way 
            to get on with their turbulent neighbour, though this had been made 
            very difficult for them by the continuous provocations of Servia. 
            The Sarajevo murder had made clear to every one what appalling consequences 
            the Servian propaganda had already produced, and what a permanent 
            threat to Austria it involved. We would understand that the Austrian 
            Government must at last consider that the moment had arrived to obtain, 
            by means of the strongest pressure, guarantees for the definite suppression 
            of the Servian aspirations and for the security of peace and order 
            on the south-eastern frontier of Austria. As the peaceable means to 
            this effect were exhausted, the Austrian Government must at last appeal 
            to force. They had not taken this decision without reluctance. Their 
            action, which had no sort of aggressive tendency, could not be represented 
            otherwise than as an act of self-defence. Also they thought that they 
            would serve a European interest if they prevented Servia from being 
            henceforth an element of general unrest such as she had been for the 
            last ten years. The high sense of justice of the British nation and 
            of British statesmen could not blame the Austrian Government if the 
            latter defended by the sword what was theirs, and cleared up their 
            position with a country whose hostile policy had forced upon them 
            for years measures so costly as to have gravely injured Austrian national 
            prosperity. Finally, the Austrian Government, confiding in their amicable 
            relations with us, felt that they could count on our sympathy in a 
            fight that was forced on them, and on our assistance in localising 
            the fight, if necessary.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Count Mensdorff added on his own account 
            that, as long as Servia was confronted with Turkey, Austria never 
            took very severe steps because of her adherence to the policy of the 
            free development of the Balkan States, but that, now that Servia had 
            doubled her territory and population without any Austrian interference, 
            the repression of Servian subversive aims was a matter of self-defence 
            and self-preservation on Austria's part. He reiterated that Austria 
            had no intention of taking Servian territory or aggressive designs 
            against Servian territory.</td>

        <tr> 
          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said that I could not understand 
            the construction put by the Austrian Government upon the Servian reply, 
            and I told Count Mensdorff the substance of the conversation that 
            I had had with the German Ambassador this morning about that reply.</td>

        <tr> 
          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Count Mensdorff admitted that, on 
            paper, the Servian reply might seem to be satisfactory; but the Servians 
            had refused the one thing - the co-operation of Austrian officials 
            and police - which would be a real guarantee that in practice the 
            Servians would not carry on their subversive campaign against Austria.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said that it seemed to me as if 
            the Austrian Government believed that, even after the Servian reply, 
            they could make war upon Servia anyhow, without risk of bringing Russia 
            into the dispute. If they could make war on Servia and at the same 
            time satisfy Russia, well and good; I could take a holiday to-morrow; 
            but, if not, the consequences would be incalculable. I pointed out 
            to him that I quoted this phrase from an expression of the views of 
            the German Government. I feared that it would be expected in St. Petersburgh 
            that the Servian reply would diminish the tension, and now, when Russia 
            found that there was increased tension, the situation would become 
            increasingly serious. Already the effect on Europe was one of anxiety. 
            I pointed out that our fleet was to have dispersed to-day, but we 
            had felt unable to let it disperse. We should not think of calling 
            up reserves at this moment, and there was no menace in what we had 
            done about our fleet; but, owing to the possibility of a European 
            conflagration, it was impossible for us to disperse our forces at 
            this moment. I gave this as an illustration of the anxiety that was 
            felt. It seemed to me that the Servian reply already involved the 
            greatest humiliation to Servia that I had ever seen a country undergo, 
            and it was very disappointing to me that the reply was treated by 
            the Austrian Government as if it were as unsatisfactory as a blank 
            negative.</td>
