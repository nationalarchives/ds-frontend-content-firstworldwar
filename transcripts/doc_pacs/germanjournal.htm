      <p align="center"><b>APPEAL!</b></p>
      <p>The journal <i><em>The War-Guilt Question</em></i>, the monthly periodical 
        for international enlightenment which has been published since 1 July 
        last year, has been highly regarded at home and abroad. Those experts 
        and journalists working in the 'war-guilt question' domain see its continuation 
        as an urgent requirement. The journal reaches almost all foreigners who 
        are distinguished in this field. Discussions with eminent foreigners have 
        resulted in the convergence of contrasting viewpoints. This journal is 
        the only one that devotes itself exclusively to purely factual debate 
        on the war-guilt question. There are close ties with other journals serving 
        the same purpose such as the <i>Historical Review of the World War</i>, 
        <i>Towards Truth</i>, <i>Foreign Affairs</i>, <i>The Nation</i>, the <i>Bulletin 
        of the Central Commission for Neutral Investigation of the Causes of the 
        World War</i>, the <i>New Historical Review</i> and the <i>International 
        Review</i>.</p>
      <p>The continuation of the journal is no longer possible if active financial 
        help is not immediately secured.</p>
      <p>Foreign countries would not understand if the journal were to collapse 
        right now, when prospects for debate on the war-guilt question have taken 
        a favourable turn. The change in England, the emergence of the war-guilt 
        question in America, the imminent publication of the final series of great 
        record publications and the tenth anniversary of the outbreak of war are 
        moments that make increased activity on the war-guilt question essential.</p>
      <p>That is why we ask that in the interests of the war-guilt question movement, 
        the journal be supported privately, according to means.</p>
      <p>Help can be given:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>a) by a one-off donation<br>
          b) by ordering an annual subscription costing 40 marks<br>
          c) by ordering one or more normal subscriptions at 8 marks for inland 
          or 10 marks for abroad<br>
          d) by giving the journal names of people to whom we can send this appeal, 
          referring to your communication<br>
          e) by you promoting this appeal yourself among your own circle of friends<br>
          f) by placing advertisements</p>
