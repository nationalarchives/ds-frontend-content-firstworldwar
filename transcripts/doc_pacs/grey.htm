            case of the Social Democratic journals, it can dictate what events 
            shall be commented on and what shall not. In the present case those 
            who direct it have apparantly decreed that comment would be out of 
            place, and their astuteness has been amply rewarded by the press controversy

            from English sources, that the British Cabinet is hopelessly divided 
            on the question of the next navy estimates. In the present instance 
            this satisfaction has not been denied him. </td>

            Prime Ministers, both of Bavaria and Wurtemberg, have spoken to me 
            on the subject, and both asked if Mr. Lloyd George's words implied 
            a split in the Cabinet. I replied in both instances to the effect 
            that England was the country of free discussions, that the Cabinet 
            was a large one, and that without doubt differences of view must occasionally 
            arise between Ministers charged with different functions, but we had 
            the Prime Minister's assurance that the present Cabinet was absolutely 
            united, and, as far as I could see, Mr. Lloyd George had done nothing 
            more than voice the opinion not only of the Government but of the 
            vast majority of Englishmen when he condemned the present insensate 
            expenditure. We had, I reminded their Excellencies, for the last ten 
            years been in favour of calling a halt in naval expenditure, and Mr. 
            Churchill had even made concrete proposals in that sense. The Chancellor 
            had said nothing new.</td>

          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is 
            perhaps a pity that Mr. Lloyd George should have drawn a distinction 
            between foreign naval and military armaments with its suggested indifference 
            to the interests of France, and it is certainly to be deplored that 
            other public speakers should have dealt on the sixteen to ten standard, 
            which was never, as far as I recollect, formerly laid down by the 
            First Lord as a permanently desirable one. Comparisons are always 
            invidious, and frequently, as in the present case, offensive. The 
            arrogant talk, in which we used to indulge, of so many keels to one 
            was not only absurd in itself, but by goading German pride was, I 
            am confident, one of the most potent causes of the success of the 
            German Navy League.</td>

            a time when the statesmen of England and Germany have done so much 
            to bring about a more friendly feeling between the two countries, 
            when not only the German taxpayer but the various Federal Governments 
            are beginning to feel the pinch of increased taxation; when, moreover, 
            the Zabern incident has brought the military and civil, or in other 
            words the aristocratic and democratic, elements in the Empire into 
            sharp conflict; at a moment, therefore, which is the most favourable 
            that has ever occurred for the development of an internal movement 
            for the restriction of unremunerative expenditure, it would be deeply 
            to be regretted if the speeches of politicians or newspaper controversies 
            in Great Britain should lead the Germans to believe that the British 
            Government were wavering in their determination to maintain at all 
            costs armaments adequate to guarantee the safety of our possessions 
            and our trade.</td>

            have already had the honour to report, no specifically hostile feeling 
            to Great Britain exists, or has ever existed, in South Germany, and, 
            since the &quot;Wehrbeitrag&quot; has begun to be exacted, the conviction 
            has been brought home both to the well-to-do classes, who are our 
            trade rivals, and to the Finance Ministers of the various States that 
            some limit must be put to naval and military expenditure. This view 
            is not shared by naval and military men, and their influence would 
            again make itself felt the moment there was reason to believe that 
            the British Government were unable to exact any more sacrifices from 
            the British people.</td>

            from contributing to strengthen our presently improved relations with 
            Germany, that they only serve to encourage the class in this country, 
            which I believe to be diminishing, but which is unhappily still far 
            from uninfluential, that sees in the British Empire an opponent to
