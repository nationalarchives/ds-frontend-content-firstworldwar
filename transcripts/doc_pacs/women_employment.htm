            turning and finishing the profile together with the boring of the 
            cavity have now been carried out by women in all parts of the country 
            and with complete success. The number of wasters produced has been 
            materially reduced by sub-dividing each complicated operation into 
            a number of simple ones. Further, the addition of stops which prevent 
            the tool turning below a certain size and also automatic cut-off devices 
            on boring lathes have still further decreased the chance of spoiled 
            work. In the roughing operations the women have proved to be capable 
            of operating <em>not only one lathe, but two</em>. It has been found 
            that, owing to several minutes being occupied whilst the tool is traversing 
            across the face of the shell, it is easily possible to remove the 
            finished blank from the other lathe and replace it by another, ready 
            for machining, without any loss of output due to this duplication 
            of work.</td>

            The sole object of this and the foregoing example is to show that, 
            if one woman can continuously operate two machines, the handling of 
            one machine is, without doubt, a perfectly simple achievement.</td>

            two machines each on 18-pounder shell bodies. These particular tools 
            are fitted with a type of tool-post which enables a spare tool to 
            be carried, so that, in the event of one failing, the other can be 
            quickly brought into operation without stoppage of output. The automatic 
            stops fitted to the lathes give the women confidence that they can
