            I gave a brief account of the German advance from the line Bendin-Chenstokhov 
            to the Vistula. This movement was a belated attempt to relieve Russian 
            pressure on Austria. When it was commenced, at the beginning of October, 
            there was no Russian infantry on the left bank of the Vistula.</td>

            armies were detained too long in Galicia. The Austrians decamped rapidly

            reports pointed to the concentration of the Austrian main body south 
            of Przemysl. So they remained for weeks, few of the troops being actively 
            engaged and hundreds of the horses dying of starvation.</td>

            When the German advance from the line Bendin-Chenstokhov necessitated 
            a rapid change of front the question arose whether it would be possible 
            to carry out the movement on the left bank of the Vistula, and, moreover, 
            at a distance from that river sufficiently great for it to be safe 
            to offer battle. The General Officer Commanding the 9th army suggested 
            taking his four corps across the Vistula at Sandomir and offering 
            battle on the line Ostroviets-Opatov. Ivanoff insisted on the whole 
            movement being carried out in rear of the river. This was the safer 
            course, but it necessitated the abandonment of all trans-Vistula Poland 
            to the enemy, brought great hardships on the troops who were forced 
            to retire on a narrow front and on the few roads of the Lublin Government 
            where the supply arrangements were quite inadequate, entailed the 
            probability of great loss in the eventual forcing of the river, and, 
            worst of all, caused delay in the attainment of our eventual object.</td>

            much as possible by seven divisions of cavalry, and two weak detachments 
            of infantry were pushed forward in support. Of the latter, the 75th 
            Division at Radom delayed the enemy for 36 hours, but the Guard Rifle 
            Brigade at Opatov was severely handled on the 4th October, losing

            to Warsaw had been defended by hastily constructed entrenchments, 
            those to Ivangorod were covered by a fort on the left bank that dates 
            from 1888, and to Novo-Alexandria by defences constructed by working 
            parties of the Opolchenie. The whole bank from Ivangorod to Novo-Alexandria

            divisions. Warsaw was soon in considerable danger, the menace reaching 
            its height on the 11th of October when the enemy's advanced troops 
            were within 7 versts (4 1/2 miles) of the city. The Russians were, 
            however, able to concentrate troops quickly by means of their strategic 
            railways, while the Germans had to carry out their lateral movement 
            by road. Several Russian corps were transferred for the frontier of 
            East Prussia, while the Moscow railway brought every day 30 to 40 
            trains of Siberian troops. Scheidemann, who was in command, was able

            The Military Governor here says that they retired in panic, abandoning 
            transport and in many cases guns and machine guns. He estimates that 
            their promenade cost them from 60,00[0] to 70,000 men killed, wounded 
            and prisoners. I believe this is an exaggeration. No estimate places 
            the number of prisoners at a larger figure than 4,000. I think that 
            the Germans retired rapidly but in complete order, without serious 
            damage from the overwhelming mass of Russian cavalry on their northern 
            flank.</td>

            which we debouched, the fine fight put up by the Austrian rearguard 
            which gave the corps commander an exaggerated opinion of their strength, 
            together with misunderstandings with the IIIrd Caucasian corps on 
            our right, caused progress to be slow. The corps staff only reached 
            Zvolen on the 27th. The Guards Corps lost 2,700 men in four days' 
            fighting. On the left the 25th corps had an equal number of casualties 
            in a single reserve division. from the 26th large parties of Hungarians 
            and Slovaks surrendered, and by the following night the Guard, 25th 
            and 14th corps had taken about 12,000 prisoners. All local reports 
            agree regarding the contrast between the disorganization of the Austrian 
            rear services and the order which reigns in the German army. Hundreds 
            of wounded Austrians were found at Zvolen who had not been fed for 
            days or had their wounds looked to.</td>

            or six reserve corps in the field, though, of course, they are all 
            of a lower establishment or filled by older classes of reservists.
