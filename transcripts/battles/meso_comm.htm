              There are two methods of concealing a failure. The first is to suppress 
              all mention of it. The second is to obscure its significance by 
              the glare of a contemporaneous achievement. The first method was, 
              as we have seen, used at the first battle of Kut. It was the second 
              method which obtained after the battle of Ctesiphon, when the military 
              success of withdrawing all the wounded in the face of a pursuing 
              enemy diverted attention from the grave medical defects which were 
              disclosed in the course of that operation.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;58.We 
              do not here enter fully into the details of the Battle of Ctesiphon 
              and of the lamentable breakdown of medical arrangements which followed 
              it. This is done at length by the Vincent-Bingley Commissioners 
              and elsewhere in our own Report.* [footne: See Part X., para. 24] 
              It will be sufficient to recapitulate that a tactical victory was 
              turned into a strategical defeat: General Townshend was obliged 
              to retire before superior forces with casualties amounting to approximately 
              one-third of the force with which he entered into battle. Over 3,500 
              wounded had to be removed from the battle field to the river bank, 
              in some cases a distance of ten miles, without proper ambulance 
              transport, and with an insufficiency of medical personnel, of food 
              and of comforts, so that a large proportion had to make their way 
              on foot in spite of their injured condition. When they arrived at 
              the river, the available steamer accommodation was gravely inadequate. 
              The wounded and weary men had to be crowded into steamers and barges 
              without sufficient medical attention, appliances, or conveniences. 
              Some of the wounded were disembarked at Amarah, but the majority 
              went on down to Basra, a journey from the battlefield, which, in 
              some cases, took as much as fourteen days, and the discomforts of 
              which were aggravated for the wounded by the presence on board of 
              many cases of dysentery and other sickness.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 59. 
              Thus the sick and wounded were put to great sufferings during the 
              evacuation from the battlefield to the river bank at Laj, and also 
              during the protracted journey down the river. Though the successful 
              evacuation of the wounded in the face of a superior and pursuing 
              enemy was a fine military performance, it was carried out in a manner 
              which involved for the sick and wounded conditions of neglect, misery, 
              and suffering, which were lamentable. Not a hint of this regrettable 
              breakdown is to be found in the official report sent to England 
              after the battle.</p>

              We are reluctant to describe the details of the condition in which 
              many of the wounded arrived at Basra, on account of their sickening 
              horror; but we deem it necessary to quote one witness on this subject, 
              because it brings home the appalling nature of the sufferings which 
              were thus glossed over by the authorities. Major Carter, I.M.S., 
              who was in medical charge of the hospital ship &quot;Varela&quot; 
              at Basra, waiting for the wounded from Ctesiphon, thus describes 
              the arrival of one of the river convoys:- </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p>&quot;I was standing on the bridge in the evening when the &quot;Medjidieh&quot; 
                arrived. She had two steel barges without any protection against 
                the rain, as far as I remember. As this ship, with two barges, 
                came up to us I saw that she was absolutely packed, and the barges 
                too, with men. The barges were slipped, and the &quot;Medjidieh&quot; 
                was brought alongside the &quot;Varela.&quot; When she was about 
                300 or 400 yards off it looked as if she was festooned with ropes. 
                The stench when she was close was quite definite, and I found 
                that what I mistook for ropes were dried stalactites of human 
                f&aelig;ces. The patients were so huddled and crowded together 
                on the ship that they could not perform the offices of Nature 
                clear of the edge of the ship, and the whole of the ship's side 
                was covered with stalactites of human f&aelig;ces This is what 
                I then saw. A certain number of men were standing and kneeling 
                on the immediate perimeter of the ship. Then we found a mass of 
                men huddled up anyhow - some with blankets and some without. They 
                were lying in a pool of dysentery about 30 feet square. They were 
                covered with dysentery and dejecta generally from head to foot. 
                With regard to the first man I examined, I put my hand into his 
                trousers, and I thought that he had a h&aelig;morrhage. His trousers 
                were full almost to his waist with something warm and slimy. I 
                took my hand out, and thought it was blood clot. It was dysentery. 
                The man had a fractured thigh, and his thigh was perforated in 
                five or six places. He had apparently been writhing about the 
                deck of the ship. Many cases were almost as bad. There were a 
                certain number of cases of terribly bad bed sores. In my report 
                I describe mercilessly to the Government of India how I found 
                men with their limbs splinted with wood strips from &quot;Johnny 
                Walker&quot; whisky boxes, &quot;Bhoosa&quot; wire, and that sort 
                of thing.&quot; 
            </blockquote>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were they 
            British or Indian? - British and Indian mixed.

              do not wish it to be inferred that the conditions on all the river 
              steamers reached this pitch of horror. The conditions, for example, 
              in the &quot;Blosse Lynch&quot; and the &quot;Mosul,&quot; two ships 
              which on this occasion had been prepared beforehand for the wounded, 
              though unsatisfactory, were probably superior to those in the &quot;Medjidieh.&quot; 
              On the other hand there is evidence that the conditions in some 
              of the other boats were as bad as or worse than in the &quot;Medjidieh.&quot;</p>

              We will now see how the evacuation of the wounded, resulting in 
              such appalling conditions, was officially described by the General 
              Officer Commanding the Expedition. We append two telegrams on the 
              subject:-</p>
            <blockquote>

                Dated December 4th, 1915.<br>
                C. 243. On arrival wounded at Basra. Please telegraph urgently 
                particulars and progress.<br>
                <em>From</em> - General Nixon, Basra.<br>
                To- Secretary of State for India.<br>
                Dated December 7th, 1915.<br>
                940/28/A. Your C. 243. Wounded satisfactorily disposed of. Many 
                likely to recover in country comfortably placed in hospitals at 
                Amara and Basra. Those for invaliding are being placed direct 
                on two hospital ships that were ready at Basra on arrival of river 
                boats. General condition of wounded very satisfactory. Medical 
                arrangements under circumstances of considerable difficulty worked 
                splendidly.</p>

            had great difficulty in ascertaining who actually drafted this telegram 
            and was responsible for its despatch. Sir John Nixon, who was ill 
            at the time it was sent, in his evidence before us stated that he 
            had only a dim, if any, recollection of the circumstance, but he admitted 
            having seen it the day after its despatch, and as it was sent in his 
            name he accepted the responsibility for it.</td>
