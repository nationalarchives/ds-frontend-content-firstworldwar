          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have 
            now heard from Carden that he considers it will take him 14 days on 
            which firing is practicable to enter the Sea of Marmora, counting 
            from the 2nd of March. Of course bad weather would prolong, and a 
            collapse of the Turkish resistance at the later forts would shorten 
            this period. But it seems to me we ought now to fix a date for the 
            military concentration so that the arrival of troops can be timed 
            to fit in with the normal fruition of the naval operation. The transports 
            for the 30,000 troops from Egypt, less those already taken to Lemnos, 
            will all have arrived at Alexandria between the 8th and the 15th, 
            that is to say the troops could be landed at Bulair or, alternatively, 
            if practicable, taken through the Straits to Constantinople about 
            the 18th instant. By the same date the transports conveying the 8,000 
            men of the Naval Division from England could also reach the same points. 
            In addition there are, I understand, in Lemnos 4,000 Australians and 
            2,000 Marines of the Royal Naval Division. Therefore I suggest for 
            your consideration, and for the proper co-ordination of naval and 
            military policy, that we fix in our own minds the 20th March as the 
            date on which 40,000 British troops will certainly be available for 
            land operations on Turkish soil. To make sure of this date, it will 
            perhaps be better to give all orders as for the 17th or 18th; we should 
            then have a little in hand. I think the French should be given this 
            date (20th) as their point, and should rendezvous at Lemnos not later 
            than the 16th. We should also inform the Russians and the Greeks, 
            and ask them what dates they can work to (assuming they are coming). 
            It is necessary for me to know what your views and plans are in these 
            matters.</td>

            it my duty also to represent the strong feeling we have at the Admiralty 
            that there should be placed at the head of this army so variously 
            composed, a general officer of high rank and reputation, who has held 
            important commands in war. I heard yesterday with very great pleasure 
            you mentioned the name of Sir Ian Hamilton as the officer you had 
            designated for the main command in this theatre. Certainly no choice 
            could be more agreeable to the Admiralty and to the Navy; but I would 
            venture to press upon you the desirability of this officer being on 
            the spot as soon as possible, in order that he may concert with the 
            Admiral <span class="strikethrough">on</span> the really critical 
            and decisive operations which may be required at the very outset.
