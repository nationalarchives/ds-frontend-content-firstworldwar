      <p>Unable to write up diary for some days now. On 2nd I had another attack 
        of Colic and stopped in bed all day except to take Holy Communion which 
        one Soldier attended as he was out from Hospital and had to go back to 
        the trenches at once. He was looking terribly ill and thin - no clothes 
        but what he stood up in - not even an overcoat. Major Lodge came in from 
        the Fort &amp; had a long break and several others came to have a chat 
        also. Bitterly Cold. Read a good deal. The next day (3rd) was able to 
        get up and go out. Bought several things from late Colonel Courtenay's 
        &amp; Capt[ain] Begg's Sale. At 5.30 Johnston (R[oyal] A[rtillery]) &amp; 
        I were just starting for a stroll when shells came over and as we were 
        well in the danger zone we postponed our walk to a more favourable day! 
        On 4th poor Captain Alexander IMS. att[ache]d to 1/7th Gurkhas got shot 
        straight through the head. He moved out of the 1st line trenches as all 
        was quiet when a stray bullet got him. It was about the only one fired 
        for about an hour. He leaves a young wife and 2 small children - an especially 
        sad case as he was very poorly off. An aeroplane of ours was up today. 
        It dropped some cig[arette]s for the Norfolks. We expected great news 
        of our Relief, but no not yet! But the following appeared on the notice 
        Board from The Viceroy to General Aylmer -: viz<br>
        &quot;Please transmit following message from me to General Townshend. 
        The bravery &amp; endurance with which you and the troops under your command 
        have resisted the attacks of the enemy have excited the admiration of 
        all and I am confident resistance will be maintained until help reaches 
        you in the near future. India thinks of you and your troops all the time.&quot;<br>
        On 5th we had more heavy shell fire - several came close by (the Serai) 
        us - one man had a &quot;Windy Lizzy&quot; 3 yards from where he was sitting 
        but it never exploded. It was carefully removed next day and plumped in 
        River. I read Evening Prayers about every 3rd day in Officers Hospital 
        - but its very hard to supply all needs. On 7th took Evensong in Gen[eral] 
        Hosp[ital] which was very jolly &amp; the hymns were splendidly sung. 
        On 8th I took Holy Communion there for the poor wounded and administered 
        the Sacrament to 14 of them. On Sunday 6th there were 28 Communicants 
        and 22 at Evensong. Heavily shelled again on Sunday Evening bet[ween] 
        4 &amp; 5pm. This is most annoying as it prevents people coming to Evensong. 
        Shells were very near to 5in[ch] guns falling right between gunpits. Have 
        been given tobacco &amp; Cig[arette]s lately and...<br>
