        Fourth Army No. G.S.2/10. </div>
      <p class="underline">5th Brigade R.A.F.</p>
      <p> The important part played by the 5th Brigade R.A.F. in the battle of 
        the 8th August has filled me with admiration, and I desire to express 
        to all ranks my sincere appreciation of the invaluable assistance they 
        have rendered in winning so decisive a victory.</p>
      <p> The action of low flying machines on &quot;Z&quot; day, though it entailed 
        heavy casualties, had a serious effect in lowering the enemy's moral and 
        inflicting actual losses, as is shown by captured documents. The damage 
        done by bombing squadrons both by day and night, the reports of the contact 
        patrols, and the constant and hazardous work of the artillery machines 
        had a very marked influence in bringing about the unqualified success 
        of the operations.</p>
      <p> I have been particularly struck by the vigour with which the balloons 
        were rapidly pushed forward in close support of the firing line and the 
        valuable assistance they rendered to the staff and to the artillery.</p>
      <p> I desire to express to all ranks of the R.A.F., and especially to pilots 
        and observers (including the balloons), my warmest thanks for their conspicuous 
        gallantry and prowess. In no battle of the war have they taken part with 
        greater success in dealing with ground targets, or with more credit to 
        themselves in combats in the upper air, and I offer one and all my very 
        hearty congratulations on their splendid performances.</p>
