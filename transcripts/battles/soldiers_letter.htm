    <td valign="top" class="texttranscript">... after daybreak. Whilst filing 
      along the main communication trench we had to pass a gloomy sight 2 or 3 
      poor figures mutilated by a shell. 
      <p>Death takes no form more terrible to look upon than when a shell has 
        burst right in a trench - it generally means mutilation.</p>
      <p>But we got to our own station where we simply had to wait until Z[ero] 
        hour sh[oul]d arrive (like a Cambridge Boat race)</p>
      <p>The day was going to be one of the sunniest that summer brings: the fields 
        even up to edges of the trenches were wonderfully beautiful &amp; rich 
        with flowers. The larks were singing like mad - the louder the bombardment. 
        Our guns had been going all week but about 6.30 they burst out into their 
        loudest &amp; most concentrated ROAR. I soon got the message that 7.30 
        was the hour. Strangely enough my spirits were beginning to rise more 
        &amp; more. I felt jovial hilarious &amp; an absorbing excitement made 
        me almost long for Z[ero] hour to be up &amp; over the top - one of a 
        victorious sweeping army.</p>
      <p>We (above) My company were not in the first line but had to follow the 
        first battalions: dividing into small bodies to sweep up &amp; consolidate 
        the first 3 lines of Boche trenches - not so difficult or dangerous a 
        job as some. Everything had been worked out mathematically before hand. 
        Zero came &amp; 3 min[ute]s after I swarmed the trench ladder followed 
        by a party whom I conducted to their place of entry in the Boche lines.</p>
      <p>On the left the Boches Gordons were going over as on parade.</p>
      <p>Occasionally a shell w[oul]d burst &amp; some poor fellow w[oul]d be 
        torn asunder. Men dropped out just as you read in books or see in pictures: 
        in the midst of the great tumult there was a strange silence somehow.<br>
