            of the battalion was held up by wire, but a portion managed to cross 
            the trenches and advanced over the crest to the support line. The 
            2nd South Wales Borderers on their left did not succeed in penetrating 
            the enemy's line. Meantime the enemy barrage on our front line caused 
            many losses amongst the 1st K.O.S.B. and the 1st Border Regiment and 
            the K.O.S.B. crossed the parapet, but except for some of the leading

            and immediately came under heavy cross machine-gun fire. A few reached 
            the mine crater, but none got as far as the enemy's wire. On the left 
            one company of the 1st Lancashire Fusiliers and the two companies 
            of the same regiment in the Sunken Road advanced simultaneously, but 
            failed to penetrate the enemy's wire, and the survivors took refuge 
            in any available cover. Meantime the enemy's barrage on our own front 
            lines so hindered our advance that the supporting battalions did not 
            cross the parapet until 7.55 a.m. The 16th Middlesex on the left moved 
            forward steadily, and reached the crater with considerable losses.

            in the rear were checking the advance of the supporting battalions, 
            resolved to make another effort to capture the front line. At 8.37 
            a.m. he ordered the 88th Bde. to attack the German front line with 
            2 battalions between the western point of the &quot;Y&quot; Ravine

            on the right had failed with the attack on their left. At 10.5, when 
            it became clear that the 88th Bde. had failed to advance, General

            two remaining battalions of the 88th Bde. for a fresh attack on &quot;Y&quot; 
            Ravine in conjunction with an attack by the 4th Division. The Divnl. 
            artillery was accordingly ordered to recommence the bombardment at 
            11.0 o'clock and to lift at 12.30 p.m. At 12 noon the fire of the 
            heavy artillery was brought back to the enemy's front line at BEAUMONT 
            HAMEL, with orders to lift at 12.25. At 12.10 p.m. the 88th Bde. requested 
            that the hour of attack might be deferred until 12.45, as the 4th 
            Worcesters had not reached the front line owing to the congested state 
            of the trenches. At 1.15 p.m. it was reported that the 4th Worcesters 
            had not attacked and the artillery barrage was accordingly replaced 
            on the enemy's front line. At 1.50 p.m. instructions were issued for 
            the line to be consolidated and the trenches cleared, as all hope 
            of further advance that day was futile. The 2nd Royal Fusiliers had 
            meantime been driven back from the mine crater by trench mortar fire, 
            and the 1st Lancashire Fusiliers, who made another effort to advance 
            at noon, had been compelled to abandon the attempt.</td>
