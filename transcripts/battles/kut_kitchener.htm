      <p>4th. May 1916.</p>
      <p>MY LORDS.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad 
        that the Noble and Gallant Lord has afforded me this opportunity of paying 
        a tribute to General Townshend and his troops, whose dogged determination 
        and splendid courage have earned for them so honourable a record.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is well 
        known how, after a series of brilliantly fought engagements, General Townshend 
        decided to hold the strategically important position at Kut-el-Amara, 
        and it will not be forgotten that his dispositions for the defences of 
        that <span class="strikethrough">position</span> (<i>handwritten</i>) 
        place were so excellent and so complete that the enemy, notwithstanding 
        large numerical superiority, was wholly unable to penetrate his lines.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noble Lords 
        will not fail to realise how tense was the strain borne by those troops 
        who for more than twenty weeks held to their posts under conditions of 
        abnormal climatic difficulty, and on rations calculated for protraction 
        to the furthest possible period until <span class="strikethrough">as it 
        proved</span> imminent starvation itself compelled the capitulation of 
        this gallant garrison, which consisted of 2,970 British and some 6,000 
        Indian troops <span class="strikethrough">with</span> including followers.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Townshend 
        and his troops in their honourable captivity will have the satisfaction 
        of knowing that, in the opinion of their comrades, which I think I may 
        say this House and the country fully share, they did all that was humanly 
        possible to resist to the last, and that their surrender reflects no discredit 
        on themselves or on the record of the British and Indian armies.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every effort 
        was of course made to relieve the beleaguered force, and I am not travelling 
        beyond the actual facts in saying that to the adverse elements alone was 
        due the denial of success; the constant rain and consequent floods not 
        only impeding the advance but compelling - in lieu of <span class="strikethrough">a</span> 
        turning movement(handwritten)s - <span class="strikethrough">a</span> 
        direct attack(handwritten)s on an almost impossibly narrow front. No praise 
        would seem extravagant for the troops under <span class="strikethrough">the 
        leadership of</span> Sir Percy Lake and Sir George Gorringe, and that 
        they did not reap the fruit of their courage and devotion is solely due 
        to the circumstances which fought against them.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last message 
        sent by General Townshend from Kut was addressed in these terms:- </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>&quot;We are pleased to know that we have done our duty, and recognise 
          that our situation is one of the fortunes of war. We thank you and General 
          Gorringe and all ranks of the Tigris force for the great efforts you 
          have made to save us.&quot;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the 
        House, no less that the country at large, will endorse these words, and 
        I am sure that those who held - and those who strained every nerve to 
        relieve - Kut, have alike earned our admiration and gratitude.</p> <br>
