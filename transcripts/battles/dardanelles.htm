              We think that, when it was decided to undertake an important military 
              expedition to the Gallipoli Peninsula, sufficient consideration 
              was not given to the measures necessary to carry out such an expedition 
              with success. We have already pointed out in paragraph 15 that it 
              had been apparent in February, 1915, that serious military operations 
              might be necessary. Under these circumstances we think that the 
              conditions of a military attack on the Peninsula should have been 
              studied and a general plan prepared by the Chief of the Imperial 
              General Staff, Sir James Wolfe Murray, special attention being paid 
              to the probable effect of naval gun fire in support of the troops; 
              and that it was the duty of the Secretary of State for War to ensure 
              that this was done.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.We 
              think that the difficulties of the operations were much underestimated. 
              At the outset all decisions were taken and all provisions based 
              on the assumption that, if a landing were effected, the resistance 
              would be slight and the advance rapid. We can see no sufficient 
              ground for this assumption. The short naval bombardment in November, 
              1914, had given the Turks warning of a possible attack, and the 
              naval operations in February and March of 1915 led naturally to 
              a great strengthening of the Turkish defences. The Turks were known 
              to be led by German officers, and there was no reason to think that 
              they would not fight well, especially in defensive positions. These 
              facts had been reported by Admiral de Robeck and Sir Ian Hamilton.</p>

              We think that the position, which in fact, existed after the first 
              attacks in April and the early days of May should have been regarded 
              from the outset as possible and the requisite means of meeting it 
              considered. This would have made it necessary to examine and decide 
              whether the demands of such extended operations could be met consistently 
              with our obligations in other theatres of war. In fact those obligations 
              made it impossible in May, June and July to supply the forces with 
              the necessary drafts, gun ammunition, high explosives and other 
              modern appliances of war.</p>

              We are of the opinion that, with the resources then available, success 
              in the Dardanelles, if possible, was only possible upon condition 
              that the Government concentrated their efforts upon the enterprise 
              and limited their expenditure of men and material in the Western 
              theatre of war. This condition was never fulfilled. </p>

              After the failure of the attacks which followed the first landing 
              there was undue delay deciding upon the course to be pursued in 
              the future. Sir Ian Hamilton's appreciation was forwarded on May 
              17th, 1915. It was not considered by the War Council or the Cabinet 
              until June 7th. The reconstruction of the Government which took 
              place at this most critical period was the main cause of the delay. 
              As a consequence the despatch of the reinforcements asked for by 
              Sir Ian Hamilton in his appreciation was postponed for six weeks.</p>

              We think that the plan of attack from Anzac and Suvla in the beginning 
              of August was open to criticism. The country over which the attack 
              had to be made was very difficult, especially at Anzac. In order 
              to obtain if possible the element of surprise, the main advance 
              of the Anzac force up the north-western spurs of Sari Bahr was undertaken 
              at night, the risk of misdirection and failure being much increased 
              thereby. The plan, however, was decided upon after a consideration 
              of other plans, and with the concurrence of the commander of the 
              Anzac Corps, who had been in command since the first landing. </p>

              7. The operations at Suvla were a severe trial for the force consisting 
              of troops who had never been under fire, but we think that after 
              taking into consideration and making every allowance for the difficulties 
              of the attack and the inexperience of the troops, the attack was 
              not pressed as it should have been at Suvla on the 7th and 8th August, 
              and we attribute this in a great measure to a want of determination 
              and competence in the Divisional Commander and one of his Brigadiers. 
              The leading of the 11th Division and the attached battalions of 
              the 10th Division, which constituted the main body of the attack, 
              was not satisfactory. As explained in paragraphs 108 and 109, the 
              orders given by General Hammersley were confused and the work of 
              his staff defective. Major-General Hammersley's health had in the 
              past been such that it was dangerous to select him for a divisional 
              command in the field, although he seemed to have recovered. We think 
              that the defects that we have mentioned in his leading probably 
              arose from this cause. General Sitwell, the senior Brigade Commander, 
              did not, in our opinion, show sufficient energy and decision.</p>

            <p>8. Sir Frederick Stopford was hampered by the want of effective 
              leading above referred to, and the inexperience of his troops, but 
              we do not think he took sufficient means to inform himself of the 
              progress of operations. On August 7th, when he became aware that 
              the troops had not advanced as rapidly as had been intended, we 
              think that he should have asked for some explanation from General 
              Hammersley. In that case he would have been informed of the difference 
              which had arisen between General Sitwell and General Hill, and of 
              General Sitwell's lack of vigour and energy in leading. We think 
              that at this point his intervention was needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We 
              think that he and his staff were partly responsible for the failure 
              to supply the troops with water on August 7th and 8th. Our detailed 
              conclusions on the water supply will be found below.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot 
              endorse Sir Ian Hamilton's condemnation of the orders given by Sir 
              Frederick Stopford on the morning of August 8th, 1915, whether the 
              account of them given in Sir Ian Hamilton's despatch or that in 
              Sir Frederick Stopford's report to him be accepted. According to 
              the evidence of Sir Bryan Mahon and General Hammersley they were 
              not deterred from advancing by those orders.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 
              evening of August 8th we think that Sir Frederick Stopford's difficulties 
              were increased by the intervention of Sir Ian Hamilton. Sir Ian 
              Hamilton seems to have considered Sir Frederick Stopford lacking 
              in energy in the operations between August 9th and August 15th. 
              As this opinion is based more upon general conduct than upon any 
              specific acts or omissions, we are not in a position to pronounce 
              upon it. We realise, however, that importance attaches to the impressions 
              of a Commander-in-Chief on such a subject.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. 
              As regards Sir Ian Hamilton it is inevitable that the capabilities 
              of a commander in war should be judged by the results he achieves, 
              even though, if these results are disappointing, his failure may 
              be due to causes for which he is only partially responsible.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April, 
              1915, Sir Ian Hamilton succeeded in landing his troops at the places 
              which he had chosen: but the operations that were intended immediately 
              to follow the landing were abruptly checked owing to a miscalculation 
              of the strength of the Turkish defences and the fighting qualities 
              of the Turkish troops. This rebuff should have convinced Sir Ian 
              Hamilton that the Turkish entrenchments were skilfully disposed 
              and well armed, and that naval gun fire was ineffective against 
              trenches and entanglements of the modern type. We doubt, however, 
              whether the failure of the operations sufficiently impressed Sir 
              Ian Hamilton and the military authorities at home with the serious 
              nature of the opposition likely to be encountered.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 
              May, June, and July severe fighting took place, but its results 
              were not commensurate with the efforts made and the losses incurred.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 
              July a plan of combined operations was elaborated, which was carried 
              into effect early in August. Sir Ian Hamilton was confident of success, 
              but was again baffled by the obstinacy of the Turkish resistance. 
              Moreover, the failure of night advances in a difficult and unexplored 
              country, which formed part of the plan, led to heavy casualties 
              and temporarily disorganised the forces employed.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir 
              Ian Hamilton was relieved of his command on October 15th.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognise 
              Sir Ian Hamilton's personal gallantry and energy, his sanguine disposition, 
              and his determination to win at all costs. We recognise also that 
              the task entrusted to him was one of extreme difficulty, the more 
              so as the authorities at home at first misconceived the nature and 
              duration of the operations, and afterwards were slow to realise 
              that to drive the Turks out of their entrenchments and occupy the 
              heights commanding the Straits was a formidable and hazardous enterprise 
              which demanded a concentration of force and effort. It must further 
              be borne in mind that Lord Kitchener, whom Sir Ian Hamilton appears 
              to have regarded as a Commander-in-Chief rather than as a Secretary 
              of State, pressed upon him the paramount importance, if it were 
              by any means possible, of carrying out the task assigned to him.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though 
              from time to time Sir Ian Hamilton represented the need of drafts, 
              reinforcements, guns and munitions, which the Government found it 
              impossible to supply, he was nevertheless always ready to renew 
              the struggle with the resources at his disposal, and to the last 
              was confident of success. For this it would be hard to blame him; 
              but viewing the Expedition in the light of events it would, in our 
              opinion, have been well had he examined the situation as disclosed 
              by the first landings in a more critical spirit, impartially weighed 
              the probabilities of success and failure, having regard to the resources 
              in men and material which could be placed at his disposal, and submitted 
              to the Secretary of State for War a comprehensive statement of the 
              arguments for and against a continuance of the operations.</p>

              prevented any pressure being put upon the Turkish force in that 
              direction, and success at Suvla might have lessened the resistance

              failure to supply sufficient artillery and munitions, and to keep 
              the original formations up to strength by the provision of adequate 
              drafts as well as reinforcements. In our opinion this was not owing 
              to any neglect on the part of the Heads of Departments charged with 
              such provision, but to the demands proving much larger than was 
              expected when the operations were undertaken and to demands which 
              had to be met in other theatres of war.<br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the 
              other hand, a considerable amount of artillery was available in 
              Egypt and at Mudros for the Suvla operations, but it was not utilised.</p>

              preparation, which produced little or no material advantage. Evidence 
              was given that these attacks entailed an unnecessary loss of life. 
              Without a more intimate knowledge of the locality and conditions 
              than it is possible to obtain, we cannot express an opinion as to 
              whether it was right to undertake such attacks. We think that the 
              evidence disproves the allegation made before us that useless attacks 
              were made because of the neglect on the part of superior Commanders 
              and Staff Officers to visit and inspect the trenches and positions.</p>
