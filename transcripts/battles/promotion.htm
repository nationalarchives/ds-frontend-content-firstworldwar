              from the Vice-Admiral Commanding, Battle-cruiser Fleet. I am, however, 
              strongly of opinion that he is too junior to be promoted over the 
              heads of so many deserving officers and suggest that no officer 
              of less seniority than 31 December, 1911, should be promoted. If 
              their Lordships concur in the opinion, I then recommend Commander 
              Francis Arthur Marten, seniority 31 Aug: 1911, of the GALATEA in 
              his place. This officer is fifty on Sir David Beatty's list, the 
              fourth being Commander the Hon: @ Arthur Charles Strutt, seniority 
              30 June 1913, who is, however, twelve months junior to Commander 
              Plunkett. If approved, I submit that Commander Plunkett should be 
              noted for early promotion.</p>
