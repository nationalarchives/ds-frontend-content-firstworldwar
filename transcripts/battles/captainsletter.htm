            misfortune lay in getting a shell from one of their Light Cruisers 
            clean through a Main Steam pipe, killing instantly the Engineer office 
            and I think a leading stoker. At the same time from two boilers came 
            the report that they could not get water.</td>

            then shut off burners from the Upper Deck, engaging the enemy meanwhile. 
            The ship finally stopped, though steam continued to pour from the 
            Engine Room. With the ship stopped bad luck had it that the only gun 
            that would bear was the after one, and that couldn't be fought owing 
            to the steam from the E. R. obliterating everything. Several of our 
            destroyers passed close, but I did not signal to them for assistance 
            as I saw they were all wanted and busy.</td>

            then noticed that we had started to list to Port considerably, and 
            so I thought that rather than let the torpedoes go down with the ship, 
            and before the list became too bad, I would give them a run for their 
            money, and fired all four at the enemy's battleships who were on the 
            Starboard beam. I think they were of the &quot;Kaiser&quot; class, 
            and if any were hit at about 3.0 p.m. GMT I put a claim in.</td>

            no one within our gun range, we set to work putting small fires out 
            etc. and I also prepared for being towed, in case a friendly destroyer 
            came along. Just about this time the 1st High Sea Fleet spotted us, 
            and started a &quot;Battle Practice&quot; at us with 6&quot; or bigger 
            guns. The ship sinking fast, I gave the order to abandon her and pull 
            clear, and about 3 minutes after, she went down vertically by the 
            stern. Three German Torpedo Boats picked us up.
