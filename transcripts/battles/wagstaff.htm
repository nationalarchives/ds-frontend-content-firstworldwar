                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the explanation of 
                the little resistance, and the rapidity of the attack, was that 
                the Boche was caught half-way through his preparations for evacuation. 
                He evidently expected the main attack on the west, whereas the 
                weight of the attack came from the south. He was in process of 
                withdrawing his guns and had left infantry rearguards only in 
                the positions, consequently there was no artillery counter-preparation, 
                no protective barrage, and hardly any long range artillery reaction 
                at all, and this accounts for the easiness of the advance. A good 
                many machine guns, heavy and light, were with the infantry, and 
                they had evidently been used, but they did not bother the Americans 
                much as these advanced so quickly and smothered the Boche.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                It is a question, however, what the Boche intentions really were. 
                Some officer prisoners have said that his idea was to let the 
                Americans in as far as they wanted to come and then counter-attack 
                them, but where this limit was expected, it is hard to say. I 
                saw at THIACOURT in the railway station three 8&quot; How[itzer]s., 
                brand new, on trucks labelled THIAUCOURT in chalk, with wagons 
                of ammunition and spare parts, evidently just arrived and not 
                unloaded. There were also in the station eight 120 m.m. guns ready 
                for loading, and quantities of ammunition and engineering stores. 
                Further the Germans at ST. MIHIEL undoubtedly did not know what 
                was going on at first, and what they were expected to do, but 
                we shall know more about it when they have been able to question 
                prisoners more, and go over the battlefield more thoroughly.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                On the 3rd day, there was hardly anything done at all. From HATTONCHATEL 
                one could see over the whole battlefield and behind it as far 
                as METZ and CONFLANS there was not a sign of anything except some 
                villages still burning. The Americans pushed up their patrols 
                well up to the Yellow Exploitation Line. A constant stream of 
                guns heavy and light, was moving up all that day and the night 
                before.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
                &nbsp;The American casualties were about 3,500 of which the number 
                of killed was, I expect, about 100. I only saw in three days, 
                about 20 dead Americans in all parts that I went to, but they 
                expect there may be a good many in the woods where there was a 
                certain amount of scrapping.</p>

                The wounded coming back were about half-and-half Boche and American. 
                It is expected that the number of prisoners in the end will be 
                about 20,000. It is well over 15,000 now, but they have been drafted 
                all over the place and have not been sized up properly, as yet. 
                The German prisoners were a good looking lot, mostly, but all 
                sorts of units. The Austrians were a poor lot. [marked for transposition 
                to end of paragraph] I noticed their boots were uniformly good 
                and all of leather, those I saw. Uniforms were fairly clean and 
                the men looked well.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
                show of course must undoubtedly be judged a great success. The 
                approach march was an excellent piece of work, as was also the 
                concentration of the guns. The marches of the troops were done 
                at night and they were excellently hidden by day in the woods. 
                The weather before the attack for two days, was appalling and 
                the men of course were without shelter all the time. Luckily it 
                cleared up in the evening of the first day and since then it has 
                been uniformly warm and sunny. This has been a most fortunate 
                thing, as during the first day, whilst it was raining, there was 
                the making of trouble. Each division had set itself to make a 
                road for advance in its section, across no-man's land and beyond. 
                By noon these roads were deep in mud and in the afternoon there 
                was a hard tangle to un-ravel with transport half-ditched and 
                coming up all haphazard, but luckily they got the guns up somehow, 
                and were cleared sufficiently for the night to get some work done 
                on the roads. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
                2nd day was fine and the wind dried the whole ground so that the 
                transport could move fairly freely and plenty of stuff got up 
                in front; in the afternoon of the second day, THIAUCOURT was full 
                of supplies and ammunition, and the roads were working fairly 
                well.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There 
                was a hard problem on the northwest corner, where there had been 
                heavy bombardments for three years, and also a lot of shelling 
                for the attack. For about a mile the main road was knocked to 
                bits, but there was plenty of labour available, and as the weather 
                has been fine, it is probably alright by now.</p>

              <p align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
                roads behind the German line were uniformly good. It is only the 
                part just near our old front line and across no-man's land which 
                will give much bother. With this fine weather it should be quite 
                good by now. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One 
                saw a lot of how these fellows [the Americans] run their show 
                and of course their methods are not quite like our regular army. 
                The troops runs themselves to a great extent and there was very 
                little direction by the staff, consequently the columns of transport 
                on the roads appeared a little hap hazard, but it was all sorted 
                out in their own way and it is all part of the American system 
                which says that if units in formations cannot look after themselves 
                and run their own show, they are no good. Any how through the 
                luck of fine weather the troops have been supplied with ammunition 
                and fed and we can only judge by results. I think they have undoubtedly 
                learnt a lot and mean to profit by it. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 
                only real criticism I have on what I saw was their shocking Horsemastership. 
                Again the weather has seen them through, but if there had been 
                two days of rain, I doubt whether 50% of their horses would have 
                survived. Their horses were looking very poor and they treated 
                them very badly. They realise this and I know are going to make 
                things better.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I 
                will get complete reports of the operations for you, and also 
                send you later some idea of what is the next move, but I have 
                already reported that the front across the chord is being organized 
                so as to be held by the American IV Corps and French Colonial 
                Corps each with two divisions in line. The other Corps and divisions 
                are available elsewhere, for operations you doubtless know about.</p>
