      <p>journeys shorter, and less frequent, for they can use the wires. Early 
        morning of the 8th, we move off across to see [J]erry, and within a little 
        while of the commencement of the attack, and while it is still in progress, 
        I go forward with the Intelligence Officer, and the General. We find that 
        things are progressing very favourable, and Jerry is hopelessly routed. 
        All along the line, things are going A.1. General does not stop long, 
        and is soon on his way back, leaving me with the Intelligence Off[icer], 
        who leads me a dance, up and down the line. It is amusing to see Jerry 
        running away, but I will give him his due, he puts up a bit of a scrap 
        before he is compelled to move. Position now is, instead of our line facing 
        due East, as it did previous to the attack, it now faces N[orth].N[orth].E[ast]., 
        so that it has been a wheel almost, our left flank has only covered 1000 
        y[ar]ds, and the Div[ision]: on our left has not moved at all. The Div[ision]: 
        on our right have an advance of roughly 5 kilo[metre]s to do, and the 
        Aussies the other side of them have even more than that, so that if everything 
        is satisfactory, it will be a nasty kick in the neck for Jerry. Early 
        on, our right flank is held up in CHAPPELLY WOODS, but it is only a temporary 
        success, for Tanks are soon up and break his back, Queens are having a 
        great number of casualties, and our Int[elligence]: Off[icer]: takes over 
        command of the front line. This Batt[alio]n seems to be devoid of decent 
        officers, except for Col[onel] Bushell. Instead of the lads being spread 
        out on their objective, they are bunched together in a trench. Captain 
        Hayfield soon plans out their positions, and together, we post them. Whilst 
        engaged upon this work, we watch the barrage that is covering the 12th 
        Div[ision]: slowly advancing toward, and then we see the men that are 
        following up. It is a good sight, more especially as we can see things

        (contd) that they cannot see, as we are directly behind the front that 
        they are attacking, and we see numbers of the Germans give themselves 
        up. My eyes are on some of the Jerrys gunpits, as we see the Jerrys in 
        and out. They are between us, and the 12th Div[ision]: Very soon Capt[ain] 
        Hayfield, (Int[elligence]:Off[icer]) Capt[ain] Heath (O[fficer].C[ommanding]. 
        T.M.Batt[er]y) and myself are soon engaged in a race to get to the Jerrys 
        and head them off. I reach the 1st Dugout, in advance of the others, and 
        find the inmate waiting for me. He offered no opposition to my relieving 
        him of his Revolver, and his kit. He is a German Off[icer]. The other 
        officers having arrived, and as the 12th Div[ision]: are coming up the 
        gully, I have a good look through it [the German officer's kit], and find 
        a large fruit cake that is promptly eaten between several of us. The sum 
        total of my haul consists of Cig[arette]s, Cigars, Biscuits, Sweets, Hat, 
        Stick, Gloves, revolver, one of the smallest that I have ever seen, and 
        last, but not least, a small pocket Camera, This latter article, with 
        a bunch of papers that were in the place, I make a present of to Capt[ain] 
        Hayfield. We hand the gentleman over to a S[er]g[ean]t of the 12th Div[ision]: 
        and carry on almost through the night, when we go back to B[riga]de for 
        a few minutes. We are off back again however within an hour, and we carry 
        on from there almost into MORLANCOURT, which place is alive with German 
        Troops. At 3pm today, 9th August, and after watching one of our Tanks 
        knocking the houses down, we retrace our weary steps homeward, after nearly 
        36 hours without a break of Int[elligence]: Work, and hard work too. We 
        have 3 or 4 Machine gun emplacements marked off for our artillery to devote 
        a little time and substance to, and that as early as they possibly can, 
        and we retire just as the guns warn us of a move off by the left flank 
        Div[ision]: I sleep soundly, and on awakening, hear that the left Div[ision]: 
        have taken</p> <br>
