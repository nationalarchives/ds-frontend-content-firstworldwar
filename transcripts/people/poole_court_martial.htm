            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I 
              joined 11th West Yorkshires about the end of May 1916. I had been 
              in the trenches several times before July 1916. About July 9th I 
              went into Hospital suffering from shell shock and I was sent down 
              to Etaples. I was there for three weeks &amp; was then sent to the 
              Canadian Convalescent Home at Dieppe. I rejoined the Battalion about 
              Sept 1st when they were in the trenches at PLOEGSTREEP. From there 
              I went with the Battalion to the Somme. <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 
              I have had shell shock I at times get confused &amp; I have great 
              difficulty in making up my mind. I was in this condition on October 
              5th.<br>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I did not realize the seriousness 
              of not going up to the front line on Oct 5th. I went to an aid post 
              as I had a slight touch of rheumatism.</p>
            <p>By the Court (<em>deletion</em>)<br>
              <br>
              I went away about 5 Jan - I did not leave anyone in charge of the 
              platoon and I did not tell anyone I was going away. [.....]</p>

          The Board is of opinion that he<br>
          <br>
          (a) was of sound mind and capable of appreciating the <br>
          nature and quality of his action in absenting himself without leave<br>
          from his unit on October 5th 1916, and that such act was wrong.<br>
          <br>
          (b) Is now of sound mind.</p>
        The Board is also of opinion that <span class="underline">his mental powers 
        are less<br>
        than average </span> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>(underlined by hand)</i>. He appears 
        dull under cross-examination, and<br>
        his perception is slow.<br>
