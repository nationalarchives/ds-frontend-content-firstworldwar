              <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capt. 
                E.F. Wilkinson, 8th. West Yorkshire Regiment, states:-<br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;On the afternoon of the 11th. instant, 
                I was in charge of a Picquet of 150 armed and 50 unarmed men on 
                the Bridge over the River Canche leading from ETAPLES to PARIS-PLAGE. 
                At about 9-15 p.m. about 80 men marched towards the Bridge from 
                ETAPLES, some of them armed with sticks and notice boards. The 
                Picquet failed to stop these men from crossing the Bridge.<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
                accused detached himself from this Party and while I was addressing 
                my Picquet and remonstrating with them for failing to stand-fast 
                the accused started haranguing them. Referring to me he said &quot; 
                you want to put a rope round that Buggar's neck tie a stone to 
                it and throw him into the River&quot;, and he told the men that 
                they should not listen to me. Within a few minutes I was able 
                to get the accused arrested.<br>

              <p>2nd. Lieut. C.D. THOMPSON, 11th. West Yorkshire Regiment, states:-<br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 
                the 11/9/1917 I was one of the Officers with a Picquet on the 
                Bridge over the River Canche leading from ETAPLES to PARIS-PLAGE. 
                Between 9 and 10 p.m. the Accused started interrupting Capt. WILKINSON, 
                who was talking to his Picquet, and among other things he said 
                to the Picquet &quot;Don't listen to that bloody Officer&quot; 
                and told them to come along. Referring to Capt. WILKINSON he said, 
                &quot;that Buggar ought to have a rope tied round his neck with 
                a stone on it and be chucked into the River&quot;.</p>
