      Sir,<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have 
      the honour to solicit consideration of the following case by the Army Council.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1914 
      my late husband Capt. H.G. Brodie, 103rd Mahratta Light Infantry, went to 
      Mesopotamia with the Indian Expeditionary Force. He was wounded on December 
      2nd 1915, in the retreat from Ctesiphon, and as the Medical Officer who 
      attended to him said he could not possibly live long with the injuries he 
      had received, he was left on the field, and I was told he had been killed 
      in action. However six weeks later I heard that he had been taken prisoner 
      by the Turks. In March 1917 he was sent with four other Officers to Constantinople 
      in reprisal for the alleged ill-treatment of Turkish Officer prisoners in 
      Egypt. Shortly before he went to Constantinople I heard he was going to 
      have the bullets extracted. There seems no reason to doubt that the cruel 
      treatment he received in Constantinople, when already weakened by three 
      serious wounds and an operation caused his death on April 26th 1917. As 
      I have a little girl whose present pension is only &pound;35 a year, I am 
      very anxious to get the gratuity which is given when an Officer &quot;suffers 
      violent death, due directly or wholly to war service&quot;. If I should 
      die it is quite impossible that she could be brought up and educated on 
      her pension. My application to the India Office for the gratuity, was refused 
      on the grounds that the condition was not fulfilled. I venture to suggest 
      that the very exceptional circumstances of my husband's death justify a 
      ruling that he did in fact suffer violent death due directly or wholly to 
      war service.<br>
