      <p>Brussels, 2 August 1914<br>
        Imperial German Embassy in Belgium<br>
        <strong><br>
        </strong> <strong>HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL<br>
        <br>
        </strong>The Imperial Government possesses reliable information of the 
        intended deployment of French forces on the Givet-Namur stretch of the 
        Meuse. This information leaves no doubt about France's intention to advance 
        against Germany through Belgian territory.</p>
      <p>The Imperial Government cannot help but be concerned that without assistance 
        Belgium, in spite of its good intentions, will not be able to repel a 
        French attack with sufficient prospects of success to provide an adequate 
        guarantee in the face of the threat to Germany. It is essential for Germany's 
        survival to pre-empt this enemy attack. <br>
        The German Government would therefore consider it with utmost regret if 
        Belgium saw an unfriendly act in the fact that measures taken by its enemies 
        force Germany for defence purposes likewise to enter Belgian territory.</p>
      <p>To exclude the possibility of misinterpretation, the Imperial Government 
        makes the following declaration:</p>
      <p>1. Germany has no hostile intentions towards Belgium whatsoever. If Belgium 
        is willing to adopt a position of benevolent neutrality towards Germany 
        in the imminent war, the German Government promises to fully guarantee 
        the kingdom's possessions and independence at the conclusion of peace.</p>
      <p>2. Subject to the conditions laid down above, Germany is committed to 
        withdrawing from the kingdom's territory as soon as peace is made.</p>
      <p>3. If Belgium co-operates, Germany is prepared, with the agreement of 
        the Royal Belgian authorities, to pay for the requirements of its troops 
        in cash and to compensate for any damage that might have been caused by 
        German troops.</p>
      <p>4. If Belgium should take a hostile stance against German troops, especially 
        if she obstructs their advance by resistance from her forts on the Meuse 
        or by destroying railways, roads, tunnels or other structures, Germany 
        will regrettably be forced to consider the kingdom an enemy. In this case 
        Germany would be unable to undertake any obligations towards the kingdom, 
        but would have to leave the later resolution of relations between the 
        two states to be decided by military force.</p>
      <p>The Imperial German Government hopes that this eventuality will not occur, 
        and that the Royal Belgian Government will take suitable measures to prevent 
        the events mentioned from taking place. In which case, the friendly bonds 
        between the two neighbouring states would undergo further and lasting 
        consolidation.</p>
