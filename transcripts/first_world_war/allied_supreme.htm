        by its <br>
        Military Representatives.</p>
      <p class="underline" align="center">1918 CAMPAIGN.</p>
      <p>To:-</p>
      <p align="center"><span class="underline">THE SUPREME WAR COUNCIL.</span><br>
      </p> <br>
      The Military Representatives have the honour to inform you that at their 
      Meeting held on 21st January, 1918, they passed the following resolution:- 
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. In submitting 
        to the Supreme War Council their advice on the military action<br>
        to be undertaken during 1918, the Military Representatives think it necessary 
        to place before the Supreme War Council in the briefest possible manner 
        the grounds on which their advice is based.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Looking 
        out over all the theatres of war they examined the state of affairs both<br>
        in the main theatres and in the secondary theatres, first of all from 
        the point of view of the security of the fronts in those theatres, and 
        then from the point of view of the opportunities which may present themselves 
        for gaining a decisive or, at any rate, far-reaching success in any of 
        those theatres. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. It was 
        assumed that the United Kingdom was safe from all serious invasion <br>
        and that the necessary measures, both naval, military and air for its 
        defence against the contingency of an attack, involved no interference 
        with the operations of the British forces overseas.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. It was 
        agreed, after the most careful and exhaustive examination, that the<br>
        safety of France could also be assured. But in view of the weight of attack 
        which the enemy can bring to bear upon this front, an attack <span class="underline">which 
        may possibly, in the opinion of the Military Representatives attain a 
        strength of 96 Divisions, exclusive of &quot;roulement&quot;</span>, they 
        feel obliged to add that France will be safe during 1918 <span class="underline">only</span> 
        under certain conditions, viz:- </p>
      <p class="tab">a) That the French and British forces in France are continuously 
        maintained at their present total aggregate strength, and receive the 
        expected reinforcement of not less than two American Divisions a month.</p>
      <p class="tab">b) That there shall be a substantial progressive increase 
        in the total Allied equipment in guns of all calibres, in Machine Guns, 
        in Aeroplanes and in Tanks, with the personnel necessary to man them, 
        and the most effective co-ordinated employment of these and all other 
        mechanical devices.</p>
      <p class="tab">c) That every possible measure shall be taken for strengthening 
        and co-ordinating the Allied system of defences, more particularly in 
        the sectors most liable to a heavy attack.</p>
      <p class="tab">d) That the rail transportation be improved, and co-ordinated.</p>
      <p class="tab">e) That the whole Allied front in France be treated as a 
        single strategic field of action, and that the disposition of the reserves, 
        the periodic re-arrangement of the point of junction between the various 
        Allied forces on the actual front, and all other arrangements should be 
        dominated by this consideration.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. It was 
        agreed that Italy was safe, but again under certain conditions, viz:-</p>
      <p class="tab">i) That the Italian Army be reformed, trained and re-equipped 
        with artillery before May 1st, and that several positions in rear of the 
        present line be constructed on modern principles.</p>
      <p class="tab">(ii) That the power of rapid rail transport be increased 
        both in the interior of Italy itself, and between Italy and France in 
        order to secure strategic unity of action over the two theatres.</p>
      <p class="tab">(iii) That, in addition to the necessary measures taken against 
        pacifism by the Italian Government itself, the Allies should assist Italy 
        by the provision of coal, wheat, and other necessaries, as well as financially, 
        in order to prevent the creation of economic conditions which would diminish 
        the strength of the interior resistance of the country.</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. If the 
        assumptions in paras 3, 4 and 5 are accepted then we have got this far 
        in our examination of the problem, viz:- that the enemy cannot in 1918 
        gain a definite military decision in the main theatres which would enable 
        him to break finally the resistance of any of the Allied Powers. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. If the 
        enemy cannot gain a final decision against the Allies the question arises<br>
        whether there is any opportunity in the course of 1918 for the Allies 
        to secure, in the main Western theatres, a final, or even a far-reaching 
        decision, against the enemy? The Military Representatives are of the opinion 
        that, apart from such measure of success as is implied in the failure 
        of the enemy's offensive, or may be obtained by local counter strokes, 
        and leaving out of account such improbable and unforeseeable contingencies 
        as the internal collapse of the Enemy Powers, or the revival of Russia 
        as a serious military factor, no such decision is likely to be secured 
        during the fighting period of 1918. Neither the addition of the American 
        troops in view during this period, nor such reinforcements as could be 
        secured for any one of the main theatres by withdrawing from the secondary 
        theatres any margin of troops that may be available above the necessities 
        of local defences, would make a sufficient difference in the relative 
        position of the opposing forces to justify the hope of attaining such 
        a decision. This should not prevent the Allied General Staffs closely 
        watching the situation in case an unexpected development should furnish 
        an opportunity for vigorous offensive actions for which they should always 
        be prepared. In any case the defensive on the Western front should not 
        be of a merely passive character, but be worked out definitely and scientifically, 
        with the intention of gaining the maximum advantage from any opportunities 
        offered in this theatre. A detailed consideration of the nature of the 
        measures that should be envisaged is given in a paper which is appended 
        as an annexe to this Note. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. The Allies 
        are, therefore, confronted with a fundamental, though not<br>
        permanent, change in the conditions upon which their strategy has to be 
        based, as compared with the conditions, existing or anticipated, as long 
        as the Russian armies kept the field. They are accordingly obliged to 
        consider how that strategy must be modified in order to take the fullest 
        advantage out of such opportunities as remain open to them during the 
        phase of deadlock on the Western fronts. In other words, pending such 
        a change in the balance of forces as we hope to reach in 1919 by the steady 
        influx of American troops, guns, aeroplanes, tanks, etc., and by the progressive 
        exhaustion of the enemy's staying power, it remains to consider what action 
        can meanwhile be taken against the enemy, elsewhere than in the main Western 
        theatres, which may enable us to secure a decision far-reaching in its 
        effect upon the political situation in the Near East and in Russia, both 
        during and after the war, and valuable in paving the way towards a subsequent 
        definite decision against the enemy's main armies. To allow the year to 
        pass without an attempt to secure a decision in any theatre of war, and 
        to leave the initiative entirely to the enemy would, in the opinion of 
        the Military Representatives, be a grave error in strategy apart from 
        the moral effect such a policy might produce upon the Allied Nations. 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9. The possibility 
        of achieving any far-reaching decision in the Balkan theatre is<br>
        clearly excluded, for the present at any rate, by the strength and comparative 
        homogeneity of the enemy forces, and by the great superiority of the enemy's 
        system of communications. It is, indeed, possible that in this theatre 
        the Allied forces may find themselves heavily attacked, and may be compelled 
        to give ground. Such a contingency, though undesirable in itself, need 
        give rise to no serious apprehensions provided always that adequate preparations 
        are made in good time for the occupation of shorter and stronger lines 
        covering the mainland of Greece, and if possible Salonika.</p>
