        to St. Salandia to be sent when the formal adhesion of Italy to the Declaration

      <p>(<em>typed</em>)<br>
        At this great moment, I desire to express to Your Excellency the happiness 
        felt by H. M. Government and by the people of Great Britain that the long 
        standing friendship between our two countries has ripened into a more 
        intimate relationship.<br>
        The Italian people have always stood for freedom and for the great ideals 
        of humanity, and today we rejoice in their decision to participate in 
        the struggle, which the nations upholding these ideals are waging to preserve 
        them from utter destruction. <br>
        Now that the will of the Italian people has been so clearly expressed, 
        I know that the valour of the Italian Army and Navy will make the achievement 
        of final victory more speedy and more sure.<br>
        We are proud that Italy has joined the Allies and that the decision has 
        been taken under Your Excellency's auspices.</p>
