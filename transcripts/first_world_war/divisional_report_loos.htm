        1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With 
        reference to your G.71 of the 13th inst. forwarding G.H.Q.O.B.893 of the 
        13th inst, I enclose a detailed report of the Operations of the 21st Division 
        during the fighting, 25th - 27th September 1915. The report on the Operations 
        of the 63rd and 64th Infantry Brigades has been compiled by me from reports 
        submitted by Brigades, and from the personal observation of my Staff Officers 
        and myself. The report on the Operations of the 62nd Infantry Brigade 
        (which was not under my orders during fighting) has been compiled by G.O.C. 
        62nd Infantry Brigade. </p>
      <p>2. <span class="underline">Causes of retirement.</span></p>
      <p class="tab">I consider that the circumstances which led to the first 
        retirement of the 63rd and 64th Infantry Brigades were <br>
        (a) The effect of fire, and especially of Artillery fire, on men meeting 
        it absolutely for the first time.<br>
        (b) The exhausted state of the men due to the march of the night 24/25th, 
        and the day of the 25th, followed by the night advance across unknown 
        ground and, in the case of most of the battalions, across the trench networks 
        of both sides.<br>
        The above two cases should, I think be considered together, since they 
        are bound to react on one another.<br>
        (c) The loss of the Brigadier 63rd Infantry Brigade at a critical juncture, 
        of <br>
        two Battalion Commanders, and of a very large proportion of officers <i>(handwritten)</i><span class="handwritten"> 
        of that Brigade.</span><br>
        (d) The fact that the attack on Hill 70 commenced at a different hour 
        to the attack further north; want of success in the former operation involved 
        the 63rd Infantry Brigade who were to have taken part in the latter.<br>
        (e) The effect alleged to be produced by the fire of our own Artillery.<br>
        (f) The casualties in the ranks, which naturally affect the morale of 
        the troops, were heavy and were chiefly incurred before the final retirement 
        commenced. Most of the severely wounded cases had to be left on the ground 
        and are therefore returned as missing. From a review of this fact, and 
        of the number of wounded men known to have been passed through the Field 
        ambulances, together with a knowledge of the average proportion of wounded 
        to killed, it appears unlikely that the number of surrenders was great.<br>
        (g) I consider, however, that, in the case of the 12 W.York. R. and a 
        part of the 10 York. and Lanc. R., when full allowance has been made for 
        all the above circumstances, the men of those units did not behave with 
        credit. The West Yorks had, it is true, their left flank exposed and had 
        lost their Commanding Officer, but they appear to have retreated without 
        sufficient cause, and their retirement greatly affected the remainder.</p>
      <p> 3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In subsequent 
        retirements, the same causes operated to an increased extent, and the 
        want of water undoubtedly began to be severely felt. </p>
      <p> 4)<span class="underline"> Confusion attending retirements.</span><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The confusion 
        attending these retirements was chiefly due to the loss of <br>
        Officers and the admixture of units. This intermingling was enhanced by 
        <br>
        each successive advance and retirement. </p>
      <p>5) <span class="underline">Loss of Equipment.</span><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loss of equipment 
        was due, in the case of one battalion, to orders having been given to 
        take off packs previous to advancing to the attack; in the case of many 
        men, equipment was left in the trenches which the men occupied and were 
        working at, and in some cases dug completely, during the early morning 
        of the 26th Sept. up to the time of the German attack. Many packs were 
        left, however, without excuse in the trenches occupied on the night September 
        26/27th, during which night the Division was relieved by the Guards.</p>
      <p>6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over 300 
        men of the three Infantry Brigades returned without rifles. Each of these 
        cases has been separately investigated. A considerable number proved to 
        be due to circumstances beyond the man's control; but I regret to say 
        that a considerable number of men abandoned their rifles without excuse, 
        under circumstances which tend to show that these men were demoralised. 
      </p>
      <p>7) <span class="underline">Adequacy of arrangements regarding food.</span><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A 
        separate report on this point is attached (marked F). <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this 
        report it appears clear that there was, or should have been, no<br>
        difficulty regarding food. Only such men as had lost, or previously eaten, 
        their iron rations, could have gone hungry.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Undoubtedly, 
        during the latter part of the 26th September, there was considerable suffering 
        on account of want of water, but the tactical situation made it impossible 
        for water carts to get to the troops. <br>
