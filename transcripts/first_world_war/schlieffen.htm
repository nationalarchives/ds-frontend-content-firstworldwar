      <p>. . . . . . The idea of an attack on these many strong positions would 
        have to be approached with scepticism. An attack from the northwest against 
        the flanks near M&eacute;zi&egrave;res, Rethel, La F&egrave;re and across 
        the Oise, directed against the rear of the position, seems to be more 
        promising than a frontal attack including encirclement of the left flank. 
        <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to achieve 
        this, the Franco-Belgian border on the left bank of the Meuse with its 
        fortified positions &#8211; M&eacute;zi&egrave;res, Hirson, Maubeuge, 
        3 small defensive forts, Lille and Dunkirk &#8211; must be overcome. This 
        necessitates violating the neutrality of Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands.<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violation 
        of Luxembourg's neutrality will have no significant consequences other 
        than protests. The Netherlands, no less than Germany, regard an England 
        allied with France as an enemy. An agreement could be reached with them.<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Belgium will probably 
        resist. In the event of a German advance north of the Meuse, its army, 
        according to plan, will retreat to Antwerp and will have to be contained 
        there &#8211; where possible also in the north by means of closing off 
        the Scheldt, in order to sever the connection to the sea and England. 
        Observation will suffice for Li&egrave;ge and Namur, where only a weak 
        military presence is intended. Huy Citadel can be taken or rendered ineffective.<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Germans 
        advance under cover against Antwerp, Li&egrave;ge and Namur, they will 
        face a fortified border, which is, however, not as extensively fortified 
        as the border that is directed against Germany [i.e. the French border]. 
        If the French want to defend it, they will need to transfer army corps 
        and armies from the original front to the threatened front and bring in 
        inactive reserves &#8211; for example, the corps from the border in the 
        Alps.<br>
