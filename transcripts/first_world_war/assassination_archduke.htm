      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I HAVE the honour 
      to report that the news of the assassination of the Archduke Francis Ferdinand 
      and his consort, the Duchess of Hohenburg, at Sarajevo, produced in Belgrade 
      a sensation of stupefaction rather than one of regret. The feeling most 
      noticeable, especially among official circles, is one of apprehension lest 
      too severe measures of repression should be exercised against the Serbs 
      in Bosnia and in those parts of the Monarchy where the Serb element is preponderant. 
      Such measures would, it is feared, excite public opinion in Servia, and 
      be made the occasion of anti-Austrian demonstrations, which would not fail 
      to bring about a tension in the relations between the two countries, and 
      lead to serious complications.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Sunday, 
      the day on which the assassination took place, happened to be the 525th 
      anniversary of the battle of Kossovo, when the defeat of the Servians by 
      the Turks brought about the downfall of the Servian empire of Dushan. This 
      anniversary was hitherto kept in Servia as a day of national mourning, but 
      this year, for the first time, it was made the occasion of a national f&ecirc;te, 
      owing to the defeat of the Turks by the Servian army in 1912 and the requisition 
      by Servia of Old Servia and Kossovo. The day was therefore celebrated throughout 
      Servia, and many Servians and Croatians from over the border came to Belgrade 
      to participate in the rejoicings, which took the form of patriotic processions 
      through the streets of the town. When the news of the assassination were 
      spread in Belgrade (at about 8pm) the Servian Government, fearing lest, 
      in the heat of the excitement aroused by the patriotic rejoicings which 
      were taking place, the chauvinist element might lend an anti-Austrian colour 
      to the demonstrations, issued an order to the effect that, as a sign of 
      mourning, all places of entertainment, including caf&eacute;s, should turn 
      out lights and close at 10 o'clock. 
      <p><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its issue 
        of the 29th instant the Government organ &quot;Somourprava&quot; published 
        a leading article expressing deep regret for the sad event, condemning 
        the murder of the Archduke, and stating that it could be the act of some 
        irresponsible maniac. The organ of the principal opposition party (Independent 
        Radicals), in its number of the same date, however, although it made use 
        of expressions of regret, gave utterance to the opinion that it was an 
        error of judgment for the Archduke to attend manoeuvres in Bosnia, the 
        palpable object of which was to rehearse the defence of that province 
        against a Serbo-Montenegrin attack, and to hold parades in a center of 
        Serbism like Sarajevo just at the moment when patriotic rejoicings were 
        taking place in the Servian capital.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The secretary-general 
        of the Servian Foreign Office, whom I saw this morning, while disclaiming 
        for the Servian Government all responsibility for the crime, used language 
        very similar to this. I am informed in confidence by my Italian colleague 
        that an interview of considerable violence took place between M. Grouitch 
        and the Austrian Charg&eacute; d'Affaires on the occasion of the latter's 
        visit to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to return thanks for M. Grouitch's 
        call of condolence. It appears that M. de Storck asked the Secretary-General 
        unofficially whether the Servian Government did not consider it advisable 
        to hold an investigation into the circumstances of the crime in view of 
        the fact that both prisoners had recently been in Belgrade. This was apparently 
        much resented by M. Grouitch, as implying responsibility for the crime 
        on the part of the Servian Government. High words ensued, and for the 
        moment relations between the Austrian legation and the Servian Ministry 
        for Foreign Affairs are very strained. <br>
