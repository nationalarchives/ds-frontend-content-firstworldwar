          <td width="81%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the evidence before 
            us there are cases tending to show that aggravated crimes against 
            women were sometimes severely punished. One witness reports that a 
            young girl who was being pursued by a drunken soldier at Louvain appealed 
            to a German officer, and that the offender was then and there shot; 
            another describes how an officer of the 32nd Regiment of the line 
            was led out to execution for the violation of two young girls, but 
            reprieved at the request or with the consent of the girls' mother. 
            These instances are sufficient to show that the maltreatment of women 
            was no part of the military scheme of the invaders, however much it 
            may appear to have been the inevitable result of the system of terror 
            deliberately adopted in certain regions. Indeed, so much is avowed; 
            &quot;I asked the commander why we had been spared,&quot; says a lady 
            in Louvain, who deposes to having suffered much brutal treatment during 
            the sack. He said, &quot;We will not hurt you any more. Stay in Louvain. 
            All is finished.&quot; It was Saturday, August 29th and the reign 
            of terror was over.</td>

          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from the crimes committed in 
            special areas and belonging to a scheme of systematic reprisals for 
            the alleged shooting by civilians, there is evidence of offences committed 
            against women and children by individual soldiers, or by small groups 
            of soldiers, both in the advance through Belgium and France as in 
            the retreat from the Marne. Indeed, the discipline appears to have 
            been loose during the retreat, and there is evidence as to the burning 
            of villages, and the murder and violation of their female inhabitants 
            during this episode of the war.</td>

            which may be connected in some instances with a perverted form of 
            sexual instinct.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A third form of 
            mutilation, the cutting of one or both hands, is frequently said to 
            have taken place. In some cases where this form of mutilation is alleged 
            to have occurred it may be the consequence of a cavalry charge up 
            a village street, hacking and slashing at everything in the way; in 
            others the victim may possibly have held a weapon, in others the motive 
            may have been the theft of rings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

            cases of the slaughter (often accompanied by mutilation) of whole 
            families, including not infrequently that of quite small children. 
            In two cases it seems to be clear that preparations were made to burn 
            a family alive. These crimes were committed over a period of many 
            weeks and simultaneously in many places, and the authorities must 
            have known or ought to have known that cruelties of this character 
            were being perpetrated, nor can anyone doubt that they could have 
            been stopped by swift and decisive action on the part of the heads 
            of the Germany army.</td>

            it must have been commanded or acquiesced in by officers, and in some

            placed in the Appendix, because the circumstances are in most instances 
            much the same. They were often accompanied with cruelty, and the slaughter

            from a tree, or else as lying gashed and mutilated in a cottage kitchen 
            or bedroom, the woman in question gave some provocation. She may by 
            act or word have irritated her assailant, and in certain instances

            side of the road on our left-hand side watching the soldiers go by. 
            Her name was G . . . . ., aged about sixty-three, and a neighbour 
            of mine. The officer asked the woman for some water in good French. 
            She went inside her son's cottage to get some and brought it immediately 
            he had stopped. The officer went into the cottage garden and drank 
            the water. The woman then said, when she saw the prisoners, 'Instead 
            of giving you water you deserve to be shot.' The officer shouted to 
            us 'March.' We went in and immediately I saw the officer draw his 
            revolver and shoot the woman and child. One shot killed both.&quot;</td>

          <td>(3) 23rd August. I went with two friends (names given) to see what 
            we could see. About three hours out of Malines we were taken prisoners 
            by a German patrol - an officer and six men - and marched off into 
            a little wood of saplings, where there was a house. The officer spoke 
            Flemish. He knocked at the door; the peasant did not come. The officer 
            ordered the soldiers to break down the door, which two of them did. 
            The peasant came and asked what they were doing. The officer said 
            he did not come quickly enough, and that they had &quot;trained up&quot; 
            plenty of others. His hands were tied behind his back, and he was 
            shot at once without a moment's delay. The wife came out with a little 
            sucking child. She put the child down and sprang at the Germans like 
            a lioness. She clawed their faces. One of the Germans took a rifle 
            and struck her a tremendous blow with the butt on the head. Another 
            took his bayonet and fixed it and thrust it through the child. He 
            then put his rifle on his shoulder with the child up it, its little 
            arms stretched out once or twice. The officers ordered the houses 
            to be set on fire, and straw was obtained, and it was done. The man 
            and his wife and the child were thrown on the top of the straw. There 
            were about 40 other peasant prisoners there also, and the officer 
            said: &quot;I am doing this as a lesson and example to you. When a 
            German tells you to do something next time you must move more quickly.&quot; 
            The regiment of Germans was a regiment of Hussars, with cross-bones 
            and a death's head on the cap.</td>

            mutilated. Whatever excuse may be offered by the Germans for the killing, 
            of grown-up women, there can be no possible defence for the murder 
            of children, and if it can be shown that infants and small children 
            were not infrequently bayonetted and shot it is a fair inference that 
            many of the offences against women require no explanation more recondite

            not actually bombarding the town I left my house to go to my mother's

            dancing about. As the German soldiers came along the street I saw 
            a small child, whether boy or girl I could not see, come out of a 
            house. The child was about two years of age. The child came into the 
            middle of the street so as to be in the way of the soldiers. The soldiers 
            were walking in twos. The first line of two passed the child; one 
            of the second line, the man on the left, stepped aside and drove his 
            bayonet with both hands into the child's stomach, lifting the child 
            into the air on his bayonet and carrying it away on his bayonet, he 
            and his comrades still singing. The child screamed when the soldier 
            struck it with his bayonet, but not afterwards.&quot;</td>
