            <div align="center"><em>(a</em>) <strong>Railways.</strong></div>
            <p>The consensus of opinion of our bombing by the German officials 
              is summed up in the word &quot;annoying.&quot; Judging from observations 
              and conversations with German officials, this statement is neither 
              an exaggeration or an under-estimate.</p>
            <p>Raids have been far too frequent to allow them to belittle our 
              bombing, and instances of really serious raids have left an impression 
              on their minds never to be forgotten.</p>
            <p>Considering the number of raids carried out on stations, the officials 
              think they have been lucky, and sum up the damage caused as slight. 
              The only exception to this was at <strong>Metz,</strong> where they 
              state that the damage had been considerable. Instances of great 
              raids, such as those previously mentioned at <strong>Metz, Thionville, 
              Saarbr&uuml;cken,</strong> and <strong>Ehrange</strong> have greatly 
              impressed them. They stated, however, that in almost every case 
              the damage was repairable within a short time.</p>
            <p>They considered our shooting was moderate, but pointed out that 
              it varied very much. As regards the stoppage and dislocation of 
              traffic, they maintained that damage had never been so great as 
              to entirely isolate a station for a period of long duration. The 
              possibilities of this danger had been minutely investigated by those 
              responsible, and the result, on the whole, had not caused more inconvenience 
              than had been anticipated. They admitted, however, that alarming 
              situations had occurred which, for short periods, had seriously 
              upset their working arrangements. Whenever traffic had to be deviated 
              from its original course it meant that the damage was such that 
              trains would not be able to resume their normal running for some 
              time. As a result of raids and alarms on <strong>Saarbr&uuml;cken</strong> 
              trains were constantly held up for two hours, or, on rare occasions, 
              for even longer periods.</p>
            <p>They stated that attacks on trains running on open lines between 
              stations had been frequent, but this was outside their experience, 
              and they professed not to know what effect it had had. In their 
              opinion, the moral effect of attacking stations had been great. 
              On occasions it had been difficult to prevent panic, especially 
              at night, when the idea of giant machines, flying at a low height, 
              was very terrifying, and greatly impressed the officials as well 
              as the general public. They expressed surprise that these machines 
              dare to come so low.</p>
            <p>At <strong>Saarbr&uuml;cken</strong> the enemy officials were very 
              proud of their A.A. defence, which, they maintained, had contributed 
              largely to their comparative immunity. </p>
            <p><strong>Thionville</strong>, they considered, was not sufficiently 
              defended, a fact which very materially lowered the morale of the 
              railway hands.</p>
            <p>At <strong>Treves</strong> the mayor considered the railway station 
              on the left bank of the Moselle of greater military importance than 
              that to the east of the town, and could not understand how this 
              had escaped almost entirely.</p></td>
          <td width="50%"><p>The opinion of the stationmaster at <strong>Ehrange</strong> 
              is interesting. He considered that the moral effect of the raids 
              had been very considerable, pointing out how people got no rest 
              from them and from the alarms day or night. As far as the railway 
              was concerned he denied that results of any military value had ever 
              been attained at <strong>Ehrange</strong>, and even the delays caused 
              could have been eliminated had there been urgent necessity.</p>
            <p>All officials agreed as to the importance of attacking locomotive 
              sheds, workshops, and permanent railway installations necessary 
              to ensure smooth running of traffic. At<strong> Metz</strong>, for 
              example, they emphasised the importance of the <strong>Montigny</strong> 
              workshops, and at <strong>Thionville</strong> those of <strong>Basse 
              Jeutz</strong>. The authorities admit that, generally speaking, 
              the material damage has been constantly recurrent, with serious 
              consequences on occasions. No effort was made, however, to belittle 
              the moral effect produced, which had been considerable throughout 
              the war, and reached its highest pitch in 1918.</p>
            <p>It should be borne in mind that the above are the statements of 
              German officials who, in some cases, have not undergone the trials 
              and dangers of bomb raids.</p>
            <p>The people of <strong>Metz</strong> appreciated the fact that surprisingly 
              little damage had been done to the town itself, and all were unanimous 
              in stating that they thought every effort had been made to avoid 
              hitting the town. </p>
            <div align="center"> 
              <p>(<em>b</em>) <strong>Blast Furnaces.</strong></p>
            </div>
            <p>Generally speaking, the directors did not attach much importance 
              to air raids. They were ready to admit the justifiability of bombing 
              from a military point of view, but condemned the Allies' principle 
              of attacking workmen's colonies. </p>
            <p>With a few exceptions the directors asserted that the material 
              damaged had been insignificant, and had not affected the war one 
              way or the other. Such damage had invariably been repaired at once 
              without any difficulty, and in very few cases had any stoppage of 
              work resulted.</p>
            <p>The moral effect of the various raids was admitted to have been 
              very considerable: the constant alarms and attacks had got on the 
              workmen's nerves. No difficulty had, however, been experienced with 
              the workers, and very few had left the works during the war.</p>
            <p>The directors stated that day raids caused them little inconvenience, 
              but night alarms and raids were feared, and were spoken of as &quot;exceedingly 
              annoying&quot; from every point of view.</p>
            <p>Our shooting, they considered, was very erratic both by day and 
              night. They were anxious to know what portion of the works was aimed 
              at; the vital points, the buildings, the workmen's cottages, or 
              the works as a whole.</p></td>
