          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have just got 7 letters from you of 
            all dates. Thanks awfully for them all. Can only write a scribble. 
            As you will have seen by the papers, we had a most successful show 
            &amp; pretty well wiped up the Bolsheviks on the Dwina. I had command 
            of the furthest column &amp; had to do 10 hours march through the 
            forest &amp; swamp round the flank. Got into position all right &amp; 
            attacked my village which we got after an excellent fight having good 
            odds against us. The Bolos fought well &amp; we had quite a job turning 
            them out of a cemetry which was well defended with M.Gs. I took 102 
            prisoners, 4 field guns &amp; a lot of machine guns. I lost 3 officers 
            out of my company - two killed &amp; 1 wounded otherwise casualties 
            being slight. Am now a long way on ahead &amp; the Bolos are well 
            away. William's co[mpan]y: comes up to give me a hand to-night. I 
            haven't seen him for a week, when I marched out from behind our then 
            front line. Most interesting show. Have a very mixed crowd with me 
            - infantry, guns, trench mortars &amp; Cossack Cavalry, but they all 
            fought jolly well. Lost my 2nd. in Command killed early in the attack. 
            Awful bad luck. Had been wounded 6 times in France. I am the only 
            officer in my Coy, who hasn't been hit as I had one killed &amp; one 
            wounded in a raid a short time ago. The rains have set in &amp; we 
            got drenched to the skin, but are now gradually drying as we live 
            in houses. Rotten having to fight among women &amp; children, as some 
            must get killed. They take a great interest in us. Williams, Prendergast 
            &amp; young Peter Williams all all right. Am very hard up for cigarettes, 
            &amp; hope Ldy Fulton's turn up, but have heard nothing of them so 
            far. Of course I will write &amp; acknowledge them when they do come. 
            Lady MacDonnell has sent out lots for the men &amp; some food parcels 
            for our mess. I heard from Annie MacD. by the last mail too. Very 
            sorry to hear about Pat Warneford being killed. No more news now. 
            Will write again when we get relieved. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lots 
            of love from your loving<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;son
