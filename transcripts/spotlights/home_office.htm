            with some sort of business which would bring them into contact with 
            ship-building firms. Two such suspected characters have already been

            as the bulk of them did, their business merely consisted in calling

            Two such persons, circus-riders, who were of German origin, have recently

            now in custody. I am therefore to request that special attention may 
            be paid to any persons belonging to these professions who may visit 
            your area, more particularly if they appear to be in the habit of 
            performing at important Naval centres, and that if there is any reason 
            to suspect that they are endeavouring to obtain Naval or Military 
            information the strictest inquiry may be made as to their nationality
