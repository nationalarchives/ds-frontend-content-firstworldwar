            Armenian inhabitants of Asia Minor. Methodically the Turkish Authorities 
            have proceeded to kill or drive out a whole race - men, women and 
            children. Half a million, perhaps more, have been done to death, and

            if not impossible, to help those who still remain within the Turkish 
            borders, some bravely defending themselves in the mountains. What 
            can be done at the moment is to save the lives of refugees in Russia 
            and elsewhere who are dying in hundreds from hardship, want and disease.

            it was deemed a considerable tax to organize relief and hospitality 
            for such a number. Since May of this year, 250,000 Armenians have 
            poured into the Russian Caucasus from Turkey. How to feed, clothe 
            and house such a number is a problem beyond the power of the Armenians 
            resident in the Caucasus. The Russian authorities have their hands 
            already overfull but they are providing such sanitary precautions 
            against dysentery, cholera and other sicknesses as are urgent. They 
            cannot do more.</td>

          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;His 
            Majesty's Consul at Batum, quoting from the Tiflis Press, describes 
            the appalling horrors which have taken place at Sassoon, where the 
            population were absolutely exterminated, only a few being able to 
            escape. The whole country was completely ravaged. A certain number 
            of well-known inhabitants succeeded in escaping to the mountains, 
            but the slaughter of those who could not so escape was universal. 
            Then there has been a great influx of Armenian, Chaldean, and other 
            refugees into Urumiah and the Caucasian provinces. A vast number of 
            refugees have arrived at Etchmiadzin and at other points of the Government 
            of Erivan. They came chiefly from the mountain districts of Melazgerd 
            and from Van. The Consul states that about 160,000 of these have passed 
            through Igdir and Etchmiadzin. He gives a most horrible description 
            of their condition, ravaged by disease, many of them starving. They 
            have been dying at the rate of at least 100 a day. Nothing could be 
            said in too high praise of the efforts which have been made to cope 
            locally with this hideous condition of things, but very much larger 
            supplies of medical comforts and of foodstuffs are needed if the condition 
            of the refugees is to be materially relieved. Then at Elenovka and 
            Ahti there are about 9,000 refugees who are no better placed than 
            the others. It is said in one report that unless relief be forthcoming 
            it is feared that half of them will probably die. There is also a 
            miserable account of the refugees in Urumiah - I have not got the 
            exact number but they are very numerous. The Russian Consul there 
            is doing what he can to assist them.</td>

            I heartily concur in what fell from the noble earl opposite when he 
            stated that dreadful excesses such as these are not less revolting 
            to Moslem subjects of his Majesty in India and to enlightened Musullman 
            opinion everywhere than they are to ourselves. They are, of course, 
            in no way authorised by the precepts of Islam, and they will not be 
            condoned by the judgment of Islam. I also agree that these stories
