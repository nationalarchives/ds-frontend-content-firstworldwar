        <strong>SECRET MESSAGE</strong></p>
      <p>.......If you could only send me some money I could get my brother who 
        is in the Navy to give me all the Navy movements, he could be most valuable 
        (but) he would want money for it. I expect in 2 weeks to be an interpreter 
        at least I have good hopes and then can give you much information, like 
        I am doing now is very difficult. The people know nothing and they say 
        very little, one must be in the thing one's self then you can get good 
        and valuable information.<br>
        I will now send you a telegram with my new name and address please telegraph 
        me the money it is safer! The newspaper trick is found out and very carefully 
        watched.<br>
