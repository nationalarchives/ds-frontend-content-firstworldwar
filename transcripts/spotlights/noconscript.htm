      This letter might be sent to the H.[ome] O[ffice]? Thanks. RC 
      <p>[To] The Rt. Hon. [Right Honourable] The Lord Robert Cecil etc. etc. 
        etc. K.C., M.P.,</p>
      <p>Confidential.</p>
      <p>No. 13 Westholm Green,<br>
        Letchworth<br>
        15th May 1916</p>
      <p>Sir,</p>
      <p>For some months a very active anti-conscription propaganda has been carried 
        on here by the Independent Labour Party, The No Conscription Fellowship 
        and kindred organisations. At first many meetings were held but more recently 
        these have been abandoned and the work is carried on mainly by the distribution 
        of large quantities of leaflets and pamphlets, although I believe surreptitious 
        meetings are still held.</p>
      <p>About two months ago I noticed an account of the prosecution and conviction 
        at Oxford of a man for being concerned in the distribution of a leaflet 
        headed &quot;Shall Britons be Conscripts&quot;. As a copy of this leaflet 
        had been delivered at my house, and enlarged reproductions prominently 
        exhibited in the town I thought it my duty to inform the Police of the 
        facts. Accordingly on the 18th. of March I saw Sup[erintenden]t. Reed 
        at Hitchin and handed him the leaflet I had received, at the same time 
        giving him particulars as to persons whom I suspected of being concerned 
        in its distribution. I have since on several occasions seen both Supt. 
        Reed and Inspector Warren of Letchworth giving them further particulars 
        of other literature distributed as well as information obtained by me 
        as to the activities of the No Conscriptionists here.</p>
      <p>Supt. Reed tells me that he duly reported the matter to his Chief at 
        Hatfield who sent the papers to the Competent Military Authority. Further 
        evidence was asked for, it was obtained by the Police and sent forward 
        some weeks ago. The Supt. adds that since then he has heard nothing more, 
        though he has been expecting at any time to receive instructions to prosecute.</p>
      <p>In the meantime the propaganda goes on with unabated, nay increasing, 
        energy; the net result up to the present being a crop of 32 &quot;Conscientious 
        objectors&quot;, but I suspect that its baleful effects will not be fully 
        felt or understood until the time comes for putting into practice the 
        forthcoming Military Service Act.</p>
      <p>I venture to bring this matter to your Lordship's notice, not in any 
        spirit of complaint, but in the hope that you may take such steps as may 
        seem to you desirable with a view to stopping a propaganda which is eminently 
        calculated to hinder His Majesty's Government in the prosecution of the 
        War. I cannot help thinking that if the responsible authorities were fully 
        alive, as many of us here are, to the harm that is being done, they would 
        lose no time in taking the necessary action.</p>
      <p>I attach an extract from today's 'Morning Post' from which it appears 
        that steps are being taken in Wales in a precisely similar case to the 
        one which is the subject of this letter.</p>
      <p>With great respect<br>
        I am, Sir,<br>
        Your most obedient Servant<br>
        (<em>signature</em>) H. Rivers Willson<br>
        late Inspector C.I.D Metropolitan Police.</p>
      <p><br>
        TRANSCRIPT OF 'MORNING POST' CUTTING ATTACHED TO LETTER:</p>
      <p>I.L.P. OFFICES RAIDED.<br>
        A Swansea correspondent states that the police raided the Independent 
        Labour Party's premises at Cwmavon, near Swansea, on Saturday. They took 
        possession of a quantity of printed matter and other documents, which 
        they conveyed to the police station. Considerable activity has been shown 
        in this district in regard to the no-conscription campaign and to conscientious 
        objectors before the local Tribunal.</p> </td>
