          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the evidence available tends to 
            show that, with some minor exceptions, practically no goods coming 
            from overseas are getting through to Germany. For this purpose, fish 
            caught by any of the northern neutrals and landed in a northern country 
            is regarded rather in the light of home produce than in that of goods 
            from overseas. The chief minor exceptions are certain colonial goods, 
            such as tobacco, coffee, and cinchona from the Dutch colonies, and 
            wines and spirits, as to which we have had a good deal of difficulty 
            with the French. It is possible that, in addition to these, there 
            may be some slight leakage by way of Sweden, because we are much hampered 
            by the Swedish laws in getting information as to the export trade 
            from Sweden to Germany. With regard to the other three northern neutrals, 
            we have fairly complete returns, partly official and partly those 
            furnished to us by our own agents, and these all go to show that practically 
            none of the export trade from the northern neutrals to Germany consists 
            of overseas goods.</td>

        <tr> 
          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Switzerland, 
            the position is not quite so satisfactory. Italy still sends in to 
            Germany, through Switzerland, a good deal of fruit, and, until very 
            recently, and perhaps still, a considerable amount of silk. There 
            is also a certain amount of trade from Switzerland in goods coming 
            from other countries which are sent to Austria and Germany in order 
            to be made up and returned to Switzerland. The Swiss position is difficult 
            and complicated, because it is under the control of a Committee representing 
            Italy, France, Russia, and ourselves, and there is a good deal of 
            bickering between the different nations, which has not improved the 
            efficiency of the blockade. But on the whole it may be said of Switzerland, 
            as of the northern neutrals, that the blockade is, apart from the 
            few Italian exports, practically complete as far as goods originating 
            outside Switzerland are concerned. </td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This result has 
            been mainly brought about by the policy of rationing, and an Appendix 
            (A) shows, with respect to the northern neutrals, how far that policy 
            has been carried in the more important goods. In the case of Denmark 
            and Holland, as well as Switzerland, and, to a considerable extent, 
            in the case of Norway, agreements have been entered into by which 
            the amounts of imports of military value allowed into those countries 
            has been limited by agreement, and where this has been done no difficulty 
            arises. In Sweden, on the other hand, we have only been able to secure 
            agreements in the case of cotton and lubricating oil. With respect 
            to all other articles, we have had to ration Sweden by reference to 
            a figure based on pre-war imports, which we have thought represented 
            her reasonable home requirements, and the same course has been followed 
            in the other neutral countries, where no ration has been agreed. This 
            is quite a satisfactory method of proceeding, in the case of goods 
            coming from the British Empire, because there we can, without any 
            difficulty, limit to any amount we think proper the imports into the 
            neutral countries. But with respect to goods coming from other oversea 
            neutrals, and principally North and South America, more difficulty 
            occurs, since we have no right in international law to restrict trade 
            of that kind, unless we can show that any particular consignment is 
            destined for Germany. To some extent this difficulty has been got 
            over, as far as the United States is concerned, by the institution 
            of what is called the &quot;navicert&quot; system. Under that system 
            the Embassy at Washington offers to receive applications from any 
            intending shippers from the United States who wish to know whether 
            a particular consignment proposed to be sent by any of them to a neutral 
            country is likely to meet with difficulties in getting through our 
            patrols. This is a great advantage to the shipper, who is able to 
            decide whether he will make a shipment before he has engaged shipping 
            space and entered into the necessary financial arrangements for the 
            transaction, and it has always been put forward in the United States 
            from this point of view. But it is also of great advantage to the 
            blockade, because before the Embassy replies, and grants what are 
            called letters of assurance to the intending shipper, the Embassy 
            communicates with London and we are enabled to refuse such letters 
            if, for any reason, we think the shipment undesirable, including, 
            of course, the case where the shipment would cause an excess beyond 
            the ration. The actual method of procedure is that on an application 
            in respect of a shipment being received by the Embassy, the Embassy 
            telegraphs it on to the Contraband Department of the Foreign Office. 
            It is there considered, and if for any reason it is thought undesirable, 
            the word &quot;Nolo&quot; is telegraphed; if it is all right, the 
            word used is &quot;Accipe;&quot; and if for any reason further enquiries 
            are thought necessary, the reply is &quot;Pendens.&quot;</td>
        </tr>

        <tr> 
          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are, however, 
            a good many cases which are not covered by this system, whether because 
            the American shippers have not availed themselves of it, or because 
            the shipments come from some South American country. In those cases, 
            our only plan is to detain the goods as long as possible, and, if 
            necessary, put them in the Prize Court. The latter expedient has to 
            be rather carefully employed, because mere excess is no ground for 
            condemnation. Indeed, there are several cases which are likely to 
            come into the Court at an early date, in which our only substantial 
            reason for Prize-Courting the goods has been that they are in excess 
            of the ration, and we are advised that there is no hope of securing 
            a successful result in these cases. They mostly arise with regard 
            to Sweden, for the reasons already explained, and negotiations are 
            now pending with the Swedish delegates, the main object of which is 
            to fix by agreement rations for the goods which are more important 
            from a military point of view. This will involve allowing Sweden to 
            have the right to import larger quantities than she has had in the 
            past year, though probably the lack of tonnage will prevent her from 
            exercising that right. It will also involve certain concessions with 
            regard to black lists and so on, which are not in themselves very 
            desirable. But, in view of the great legal difficulties we are in, 
            and also in view of the immense importance of securing increased transit 
            to Russia, which Sweden controls, I think it is well worth while to 
            make an agreement if we can. If we succeed in doing so, then the imports 
            to all the neutral countries bordering on Germany will be governed 
            mainly by agreements, and as far as overseas goods are concerned the 
            blockade should be substantially complete, provided the agreements 
            are properly enforced.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr> 
          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, 
            one big gap in the complete blockade of Germany, namely, the import 
            into that country of the home products of the neighbouring neutrals, 
            and for some time great efforts have been made to limit, and if possible, 
            completely stop these imports. The possibility of doing so differs 
            in each country, and depends upon the special circumstances applicable 
            to it. In Sweden, the principal normal exports to Germany are iron 
            ore, wood pulp, bacon, and a certain amount of eggs and butter. I 
            see very little prospect of being able to interfere substantially 
            with the iron ore which Sweden digs out of her own soil and carries 
            across the Baltic to Germany, and in some cases down the coast of 
            Denmark and Germany to Rotterdam, under conditions which prevent the 
            fleet from touching it. The only possible way of stopping it would 
            be to threaten to cut off some other import into Sweden of which we 
            have complete control. Unfortunately there are not many of such imports. 
            We were advised that we had a great lever in our coal, but when we 
            began to limit our exports of coal to Sweden, Germany increased hers, 
            and though our coal is better that German coal, the difference in 
            quality was not enough to give us any very substantial means of pressure. 
            There are other articles, such as jute and wool, which we substantially 
            control, but we cannot use them to any very great extent, because 
            Sweden has, on her side, considerable means of pressure upon us. We 
            use a great deal of her iron ore, and some of her other manufactured 
            products, such as ball bearings, which are apparently essential for 
            our munitions. But far more important than even these is the fact 
            that she controls the transit to Russia, and we receive perpetual 
            appeals from the Russian Government not to do anything which may imperil 
            that transit. Till lately, indeed, the Russian Government were very 
            much afraid of Sweden's intervention in the war. She has some 500,000 
            troops, who are said to be well trained and well equipped. That danger, 
            however, has apparently passed, owing largely to the circumstances 
            of the war, and partly to the admirable diplomatic work done by our 
            representative Sir Esme Howard. He has had a difficult task, because, 
            as is well known, a very considerable and very influential section 
            of Swedish opinion is strongly anti-Russian, and to that extent pro-German, 
            while the King, owing to his marriage, has the same bias.</td>

            materials into Sweden, a branch of trade which we control almost entirely,

          <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to wood pulp, 
            the only means of restricting its export is by limiting the import 
            of sulphur, which is essential for the manufacture of the kind of 
            wood pulp which is mainly exported to Germany. But,unfortunately, 
            the Swedes have command of a sufficient quantity of the Norwegian 
            pyrites to enable them to supply Germany with a considerable quantity 
            of the pulp in question. I am myself rather sceptical as to this being 
            a matter of any great importance, though our scientific advisers are 
            inclined to think that it is only this &quot;chemical wood pulp,&quot; 
            as it is called, which is convenient for the manufacture of nitro-cellulose, 
            now that Germany has no more cotton for that purpose. It is, however, 
            probable that though chemical wood pulp may be the most convenient, 
            any form of wood pulp would really do, and of course Germany has an 
            inexhaustible supply of forests from which wood pulp can be made.</td>

            fish, as the Cabinet know, we entered into a very large scheme of 
            purchase, part of which was that we were given an option on all the 
            fish caught and landed in Norway after the 18th August last, except 
            that the Norwegians might export 15 per cent. of it if that quantity 
            was not caught by the use of any British materials. This agreement 
            was bitterly resented in Germany, and is thought to be one of the 
            causes of their attacks on Norwegian shipping. It is unfortunately 
            true that the Norwegians have not fully carried out the agreement, 
            and that a certain amount of fish has been wrongfully exported to 
            Germany.</td>

            pyrites, the Norwegians are unable to manufacture copper suitable 
            for electrical purposes, and have consequently had to import a large 
            quantity of copper for their rapidly developing electrical works. 
            By a series of purchases and other transactions in the United States, 
            we have the command of the greater part of the world's supply of such 
            copper, and we have agreed with the Norwegians that they shall not 
            export any of their native copper, or pyrites containing copper, to 
            any belligerent country, except in return for an import from that 
            country of an equal weight of copper, and we further agreed that since 
            they wanted immediately a large quantity of electrical copper, they 
            should, before they exported any copper to Germany, give us the option 
            of taking in return a very large quantity of pyrites containing some 
            3,000 tons of copper. The result would have been, if the agreement 
            had been rigidly carried out, to stop altogether the export of pyrites 
            to Germany, at any rate for some considerable time. But, as a matter 
            of fact, we have reason to believe that a certain amount of pyrites, 
            which in the trade is regarded as non-cupreous, containing only 1/2 
            per cent of copper has been exported to Germany in breach of the agreement.

            can be safely carried. The Germans have made great efforts to induce 
            the Norwegians to break their agreements and, as I have said, there 
            is some ground for thinking that the agreements have not been perfectly 
            kept. We are now putting pressure on the Norwegians by cutting off 
            their coal supply from us, on which they completely depend, to compel 
            them to carry out their agreements to the full. But we certainly have 
            reached a point beyond which it would not be, in my judgment, very 
            safe to go in view of the advice from our military and naval authorities 
            that it is undesirable that Norway should come into the war on either 
            side.</td>

            there have been undoubtedly very large exports to Germany of agricultural 
            produce. Denmark is, from a military point of view, absolutely at 
            the mercy of Germany which, with a comparatively small force, could 
            easily overrun the whole country and carry off all the live stock 
            and crops, which are of considerable amount. This fact has been made 
            use of to the full by the Danes, and they have contrived out of their 
            military weakness to make very large commercial profits. So long as 
            they were convinced that Germany was going to be victorious it was 
            almost impossible to do anything with them, though the population 
            is overwhelmingly anti-German. Recently, however, their temper has 
            very much changed. Whereas at the beginning of last year and down 
            to June they were exporting much larger quantities of agricultural 
            produce to Germany than they did before the war, and much less to 
            us, they have now, in compliance with repeated remonstrances from 
            us, greatly modified their attitude.</td>
