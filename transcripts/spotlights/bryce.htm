      <p>My dear Asquith</p>
      <p>I write to you because I hear that Edward Grey is going away on a short 
        holiday, which he badly needs.</p>
      <p>Terrible accounts reach me through various channels, each confirming 
        the others, of the suffering of the Armenian population of the region 
        round Van and between that city and the Russian frontier. The Turks and 
        Kurds have been massacring the whole Christian population of these regions, 
        and a vast host of refugees has been pouring, homeless and helpless, into 
        Russian Transcaucasia. There are several hundreds of thousands now in 
        and around Tiflis, absolutely destitute, perishing from want and disease. 
        The Russian Government has been giving help, and some of us in England 
        have been collecting all the money we can to send out money and medical 
        appliances. But what we can thus raise is a trifle compared with the need, 
        and private benevolence whether ours or that of the Armenians in Europe, 
        cannot cope with the appalling gravity of the situation. Would it not 
        be possible for our Government, and that of France, to make a grant towards 
        the relief of this misery? Even &pound;20,000 or &pound;30,000 would do 
        much, and the moral effect would be great in giving some sort of cheer 
        to a people which has suffered more than any other during this war, for 
        they have lost everything; &amp; women &amp; children have been the chief 
        sufferers. All the men who have escaped are, I believe, fighting as volunteers 
        in, or with the Russian army; and they have rendered great services to 
        the Allied cause: I will supply you with all the information I possess 
        if you wish for details.</p>
      <p>Ever yours<br>
        Bryce</p>
      <p></p>
