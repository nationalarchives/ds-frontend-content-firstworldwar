      <p>Mr Stammer,</p>
      <p>Berlin</p>
      <p>As I have just been informed, large numbers of Russian troops were landed 
        in Aberdeen on 2 September and transported south by rail. Acquaintances 
        of mine certainly saw Russians (military) travelling through Carlisle. 
        The carriage windows were covered. I am travelling there (Aberdeen) myself 
        tomorrow.<br>
