      the 'Mons Star') was a British campaign medal first authorised in 1917. 
      It was awarded to all military personnel - including medical staff - who 
      saw service in Belgium and France between 5 August and 22 November 1914. 
      In October 1919, it was announced that those who had served 'under enemy 
      fire' during this period were also to be issued a clasp in recognition of 
      their deeds. A total of 365,622 1914 Stars and 145,000 Star clasps were 
      awarded.<br>
