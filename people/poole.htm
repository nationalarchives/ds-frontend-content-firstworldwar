              20 January 1885. His service record in WO 339/35077 shows that he 
              gained his first military experience in the 63rd Regiment of the 
              Halifax Rifles, with whom he served for two years between 1903 and 
              1905. The Poole family arrived in England at some stage between 
              1905 and the outbreak of the First World War, settling in Guildford, 
              Surrey. </p>
            <p>In October 1914, Poole joined the Honourable Artillery Company, 
              where he worked as a driver (in 'B Battery') for the next seven

              in the 14th Battalion of the West Yorkshire Regiment in May 1915. 
              A year later, Poole was transferred to serve in France with the 
              11th Battalion of the West Yorkshire Regiment, shortly before it 
              was due to go into action at the Battle of the <a href="../glossary/glossary_s.htm#Somme" onClick= "PRO_openPopupWindow('../glossary/glossary_s.htm#Somme','popup','600','400','menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes','yes');return document.MM_returnValue" target="_blank"><img src="../graphics/icon_glossary.gif" width="9" height="12" alt="Glossary - opens new window" border="0">Somme</a>.

              According to the medical history sheet compiled for Poole's general 
              court martial in November 1916 (WO 71/1027), he suffered '<a href="../glossary/glossary_s.htm#shellshock" onClick= "PRO_openPopupWindow('../glossary/glossary_s.htm#shellshock','popup','600','400','menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes','yes');return document.MM_returnValue" target="_blank"><img src="../graphics/icon_glossary.gif" width="9" height="12" alt="Glossary - opens new window" border="0">shell 
              shock</a>' after being hit by clods of earth distributed by an enemy 
              shell during fighting on the Somme on 7 July 1916. After a period 
              of recuperation, Poole was returned to duty with his battalion at 
              the end of August. He was soon placed in charge of 'C Company' platoon 
              at Martinpuich near <a href="../glossary/glossary_a.htm#Albert" onClick= "PRO_openPopupWindow('../glossary/glossary_a.htm#Albert','popup','600','400','menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes','yes');return document.MM_returnValue" target="_blank"><img src="../graphics/icon_glossary.gif" width="9" height="12" alt="Glossary - opens new window" border="0">Albert</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>According to his own testimony at his trial, the shell-shock injury 
              caused Poole to 'at times get confused and... have great difficulty 
              in making up my mind'. It was in this condition that he wandered 
              away from his platoon on 5 October 1916, during a move into the 
              frontline trenches at <a href="../glossary/glossary_f.htm#Flers" onClick= "PRO_openPopupWindow('../glossary/glossary_f.htm#Flers','popup','600','400','menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes','yes');return document.MM_returnValue" target="_blank"><img src="../graphics/icon_glossary.gif" width="9" height="12" alt="Glossary - opens new window" border="0">Flers</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>Poole was apprehended by the military police two days later and 
              arrested on 10 October. In early November, it was decided to try 
              Poole by general court martial for deserting 'when on active service'.

              on 24 November 1916, the prosecution called six witnesses. It was 
              variously noted that Poole's 'nerves seemed rather shaken' and that 
              he had confessed to feeling 'damned bad' on the morning of 5 October. 
            </p>
            <p>Two men spoke in Poole's defence, including an RAMC officer who 
              argued that the 'mental condition' of the accused had precluded 
              him from intentionally deserting his company. In his own testimony, 
              Poole outlined his recent medical problems and confessed that he 
              had been unaware of 'the seriousness of not going to the front line 
              on Oct 5th'. </p>
            <p>Despite defence pleas, however, the five-man court found Poole 
              guilty of desertion and sentenced him to 'death by being shot'. 
              This verdict was confirmed by <a href="../glossary/glossary_h.htm#Haig" onClick= "PRO_openPopupWindow('../glossary/glossary_h.htm#Haig','popup','600','400','menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes','yes');return document.MM_returnValue" target="_blank"><img src="../graphics/icon_glossary.gif" width="9" height="12" alt="Glossary - opens new window" border="0">Sir

              board sent to examine Poole concluded that 'he was of sound mind 
              and capable of appreciating the nature and quality of his actions'.</p>
            <p>Poole was executed by firing squad in Poperinghe town hall on 10 
              December 1916. He was buried in the town's military cemetery.</p>

            <p class="maintext">Eric Poole was the first British army officer 
              to be sentenced to death and executed during the First World War. 
              Despite the abundant evidence that he was medically unfit to command 
              a platoon as a result of the shell shock, Poole seems to have been 
              at least partially a victim of a political decision. In his diary 
              entry of 6 December 1914 (in WO 256/14), Haig wrote disingenuously 
              that 'it is... highly important that all ranks should realise 
              the law is the same for an officer as a private'.</p>
            <p>Poole's fate aroused little fuss back in Britain, where his family 
              were understandably anxious to avoid publicity - particularly because 
              his father was seriously ill at the time. The <a href="../glossary/glossary_w.htm#WarOffice" onClick= "PRO_openPopupWindow('../glossary/glossary_w.htm#WarOffice','popup','600','400','menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes','yes');return document.MM_returnValue" target="_blank"><img src="../graphics/icon_glossary.gif" width="9" height="12" alt="Glossary - opens new window" border="0">War 
              Office</a>, equally wary of adverse publicity, agreed that Poole's 
              name would not appear in the casualty lists published in British 
              newspapers, and that no information about the circumstances of his 
              death would be made public. <br>
