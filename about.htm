              <a name="introduction"></a>Introduction</h5>
            This exhibition makes available an online selection of unique and 
            richly varied source material on the First World War, set in its historical 
            context. It provides resources for a wide variety of adult learners 
            in the field of modern history. Whether you are pursuing an interest 
            in family or military history, studying history formally, looking 
            for research resources, or generally interested in discovering more 
            about what the British writer H G Wells called 'the war that will 
            end war', the exhibition offers something for you.
            <p>The exhibition draws on historical documents, film and sound available in Britain's 
              National Archives and one of its leading museums. It starts from, 
              but is not limited to, a British perspective on the war, and also 
              aims to create a wider understanding of the global nature of the 
              conflict and the profound consequences that resulted from it - consequences 
              which, in areas such as the Balkans and Palestine, are still being 
              felt today.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h5><a name="about"></a>About this project</h5>
            <p>'The First World War: Sources for History' is a partnership between
              <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/" target="_self">The National Archives</a>
              and the<a href="http://www.iwm.org.uk/" target="_blank">
              Imperial War Museum</a>, funded by the <a href="http://www.nof.org.uk/" target="_blank">New

            <h5><a name="main"></a>The main galleries</h5>
            <p>These are accessed by the icons on the 'home' page. 'The First 
              World War, 1914-18' and 'Aftermath' feature documents giving an 
              insight into the overall history of the war and its consequences. 
              'Britain and the War' looks at its effects on Britain. 'The Military 
              Conflict' provides examples of records relating to the fighting, 
              while 'Service Records for the First World War' introduces visitors 
              to the main categories of service records and gives examples of 
              how to read them. </p>
            <p>The galleries also offer pointers to further research and reading. 
              At the bottom of each page you will find a selection of further 
              sources that can be seen at The National Archives. The last page 
              of each gallery is a 'Read On' section, giving books, articles and 
              websites that may be of interest. On this page you will also find 
              a link to the collections of the Imperial War Museum.</p>
            <p>Each page of a gallery can be reached from the menu on the left-hand 
              side. To go back to the 'home' page, click on the First World War 
              icon in the top left-hand corner.</p>

            <p>You can reach these through the menu at the top of each page throughout 
              the exhibition. All the pages in the special resources sections 
              navigate back to a relevant main gallery and to the 'home' page. 
              Within each of the special resources sections, the various topics 
              can be reached from the menu on the left-hand side of the page. 
            </p>
            <p><b>DOCUMENT PACKS</b> - for students and general readers<br>
              These cover three topics: The Origins of the First World War, Women 
              and the First World War, and The Eastern Front. The 'document packs' 
              provide a wide range of documents, offering resources for in-depth 
              study.</p>
            <p><b>SPOTLIGHTS ON HISTORY</b> - for students and general readers<br>
              These look at a variety of First World War issues, including some 
              (such as the anti-war movement) that were controversial at the time 
              and some (such as air raids or the Armenian massacres) that have 
              been largely forgotten.</p>
            <p><b>BATTLES</b> - for those with an interest in military history<br>
              This section provides more detailed sources on five major military 
              engagements of the war: the Somme, Jutland, Gallipoli, Mesopotamia, 
              and the Allied counter-offensive of 1918.</p>
            <p><b>PEOPLE</b> - for those with an interest in family history and 
              in individual experiences in the war<br>
              These six short biographies look at records concerning those who 
              served in different roles in the conflict. They include Thomas Aageson, 
              a private soldier recorded in the 'Burnt Documents' (the service 
              records destroyed by fire during the Second World War); J R R Tolkien, 
              who served as an officer and was at the Somme; and Eric Skeffington 
              Poole, a victim of shell shock who was the first British army officer 
              to be executed.</p>

            <p><b>TIMELINE</b> gives the main events of the years 1914-20.</p>
            <p><b>MAPS</b> contains ten maps of the main theatres of war.</p>
            <p><b>QUICK REF</b> provides concise details about people and places 
              mentioned in the main text, together with definitions of some military 
              terms. You can also access the 'quick ref' section by clicking on 
              the 'glossary' links throughout the exhibition.</p>

              'byte size' of the image is given below it (the larger images may 
              take some time to download). You can access a transcript (or where 
              relevant translation) of each document by clicking on the link below 
              the thumbnail. The transcript can also be accessed from the image 
              'window' - and after looking at the transcript, you can return to 
              the image or to the main text. </p>
            <p>The aim has been to provide transcripts that reflect the original 
              documents as accurately as possible. However, documents are not 
              always clearly legible, especially if handwritten, and for research 
              purposes the transcripts are not a substitute for examining the 
              original documents. In the transcripts, obvious typing errors have 
              occasionally been corrected for the sake of clarity and in places 
              extraneous notes have been omitted. </p>

              played on a PC using <a href="/help/technical-plugins.htm" target="_blank">Windows
