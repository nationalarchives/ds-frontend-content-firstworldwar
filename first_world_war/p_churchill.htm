      <br><br>
      Following his resignation from the Asquith government in November 1915, 
      a disillusioned Winston Churchill sought solace in military service. He 
      was quickly dispatched to France as a lieutenant-colonel in the 6th Royal 
      Scots Fusiliers. This photograph, taken at a French army headquarters at 
      Camblain L'Abb&eacute; soon after his arrival, shows Churchill - in the 
      centre, wearing a French shrapnel helmet - with a group of French officers 
      (plus another British officer, Captain Spears). Army life did not suit Churchill's 
      temperament or talents. When his battalion was merged with another in June 
      1916, he returned to civilian life as a private Member of Parliament and 
      began his climb back to political prominence.<br>
