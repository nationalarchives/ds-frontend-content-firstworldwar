      XI Hussars in sight of the port of Le Havre, 16 August 1914. <br>
      <br> When war broke out in the summer of 1914, Britain was ill prepared to 
        commit large numbers of troops to a land war in continental Europe. The 
        British Expeditionary Force that was initially sent to France consisted 
        of just six infantry divisions and one cavalry division. The German emperor, 
        Wilhelm II, famously described it as a 'contemptibly small army' 
        - a phrase that was mistranslated into English as the more insulting 'contemptible 
        small army' (hence the nickname 'The Contemptibles'). This 
        small band of BEF troops fought well in early skirmishes at Mons, Ypres 
        and elsewhere. But it was quickly realised that a much larger number of 
        British soldiers was needed to combat the Germans.<br>
