      <br>
      Captured by German troops during the Ludendorff offensive in April 1918, 
      the French town of Albert near the Somme battlefield was recaptured during 
      the Allied counter-offensive four months later. In this photograph, British 
      cavalry troops are seen moving past the ruined basilica of the Notre Dame 
      de Brebi&egrave;res, whose famous Golden Virgin statue - left hanging from 
      the tower of the basilica after a German artillery offensive in January 
      1915 - had finally been toppled by British guns in April 1918. Legend had 
      stated that the war would end when the statue fell. <br>
