            <p><span class="titlesub"><b>Falkenhayn, General Erich von<a  name="FalkenhaynGeneralErichvon"></a></b></span> (1861-1922) German minister of war, 1913-15; succeeded Moltke as 
              Chief of General Staff in the German army in September 1914. A cautious 
              general, he was responsible for the policy of diverting troops to 
              the Eastern Front in 1915 and the attritional warfare in the West 
              that was epitomised by the Battle of Verdun (February-December 1916). 
              After his resignation in late August 1916, he served with varied 
              success in Romania, Mesopotamia, Palestine and Lithuania during 
              the rest of the war.</p>

              victory over the Germans in December 1914 off the coast of these 
              islands.</p>

              German historian, famous for a series of books - most notably <em>Griff 
              nach der Weltmacht</em> (1961), published in English as <em>Germany's 
              Aims in the First Word War</em> (Chatto &amp; Windus, 1967) - arguing

              after the Battle of Caporetto (October 1917) led ultimately to his 
              appointment as commander-in-chief of the Allied armies on the Western 
              Front in April 1918.</p>
            <p><span class="titlesub"><b><a  name="Fontainebleaumemorandum"></a>Fontainebleau

              Western Front, May and June 1917. Begun on 27 May, when as many 
              as 30,000 left their trenches and billets following the failure 
              of the Nivelle offensive, the mutinies reached crisis point on 1 
              June, when an infantry regiment set up an anti-war 'government' 
              in the town of Missy-aux-Bois. The French military authorities took 
              swift action to end the unrest, passing more than 23,000 guilty 
              sentences for mutinous behaviour - including 400 death sentences.</p>
