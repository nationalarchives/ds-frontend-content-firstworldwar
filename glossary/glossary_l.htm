            <p><span class="titlesub"><b>La Fert&eacute;-sous-Jouarre<a  name="LaFertesousJouarre"></a></b></span> Site of the memorial, unveiled in 1928, to the 3,888 British soldiers 
              who were killed in the retreat from the Marne in September 1914 
              but had no known grave.</p>
            <p><span class="titlesub"><b>Lausanne<a  name="Lausanne"></a>, Treaty 
              of</b></span> Peace treaty signed between the Allies and Turkey in July 
              1923, replacing the obsolete Treaty of S&egrave;vres, which had 
              been agreed in August 1920. It granted Turkey large areas of European 
              territory including Constantinople and Gallipoli.</p>
            <p><span class="titlesub"><b>Lawrence<a  name="Lawrence"></a>, T E</b></span> (1888-1935) Also known as 'Lawrence of Arabia'. He joined British 
              military intelligence in Cairo on the outbreak of the First World 
              War, from where he established strong ties with the Arab leader, 
              Sherif Husein of Mecca. As an adviser to Husein's son Feisal, Lawrence 
              helped to organise the Arab revolt against the Turks (begun in June 
              1915), which played an important part in the eventual Allied triumph 
              on the Palestine front. <em>The Seven Pillars of Wisdom</em>, a 
              highly regarded account of his wartime experiences in the Middle 
              East, was published privately in 1926. Lawrence was killed in a 
              motorcycle crash in 1935, since when he has remained one of the 
              First World War's most charismatic and controversial military leaders.</p>
            <p><span class="titlesub"><b>Le Queux<a  name="LeQueux"></a>, William</b></span> (1864-1927) British spy writer. Author of such books as <i>The Invasion 
              of 1910</i> (1906) and <i>German Spies in England: An exposure</i> 
              (1915).</p>
            <p><span class="titlesub"><b>League of Nations<a  name="LeagueofNations"></a></b></span> International association of states designed to safeguard world 
              peace, the brainchild of American president Woodrow Wilson. A 'Covenant 
              of the League of Nations' was incorporated into the terms of all 
              of the post-war peace treaties in 1919 and 1920. The League met 
              for the first time in November 1920, but its credibility was seriously 
              undermined by the non-participation of the USA. It held its last 
              meeting in April 1946, before being superseded by the United Nations.</p>
            <p><span class="titlesub"><b>Lemburg<a  name="Lemberg"></a></b></span> Town 
              in eastern Galicia. Scene of a series of battles between Russian 
              and Austro-Hungarian forces between 23 August and 12 September 1914, 
              during which the latter were forced to withdraw to the Habsburg 
              garrison of Przemysl. <a class="glossary"   href="../maps/eastern_front.htm" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('Image3','','../graphics/icon_map_over.gif',1)"  onClick= "PRO_openPopupWindow('../maps/eastern_front.htm','popup','600','400','menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes','yes');return document.MM_returnValue" target="_blank"><img name="Image3" border="0" src="../graphics/icon_map.gif" width="43" height="12" alt="map"></a></p>
            <p><span class="titlesub"><b>Lenin<a  name="Lenin"></a>, Vladimir Ilyich</b></span> (1870-1924) Leader of the Bolshevik revolution and the first head 
              of state in Soviet Russia, 1917-24. Lenin was returned from exile 
              into Russia aboard a German military train in April 1917. Wanting 
              no part in the Allied war effort, he was the driving force behind 
              the separate peace treaty concluded by Russia with Germany at Brest-Litovsk 
              11 months later.</p>
            <p><span class="titlesub"><b>Lettow-Vorbeck<a  name="LettowVorbeck"></a>,</b></span> <span class="titlesub"><b>General Paul Emil von</b></span> (1870-1946) 
              Appointed military commander of German East Africa in 1914, he was 
              a master of irregular warfare; his small band of troops kept larger 
              Allied forces in the region occupied for much of the First World 
              War.</p>
            <p><span class="titlesub"><b>Lloyd George<a  name="LloydGeorge"></a>, 
              David</b></span> (1863-1945) Liberal MP, 1890-1945; chancellor of the 
              Exchequer, 1908-15; appointed minister of munitions in May 1915, 
              a position he held with distinction; replaced Asquith as prime minister 
              on 7 December 1916 amid mounting criticism of Britain's conduct 
              of the war. Lloyd George clashed with 'Westerners' such as Haig 
              over what he saw as the futile slaughter in Belgium and France, 
              but successfully pushed for a more vigorous and organised pursuit 
              of the war. Returned to office in the December 1918 'coupon election', 
              he was unable to modify the harsh treatment of Germany meted out 
              at the Paris peace conference in 1919.</p>
            <p><span class="titlesub"><b>Lody<a  name="Lody"></a>, Carl Hans</b></span> (1877-1914) German naval officer. The first foreign spy to be executed 
              in Britain - in November 1914 at the Tower of London - for espionage 
              during the First World War.<br>

              <span class="titlesub"><b>Loos<a  name="Loos"></a></b></span> Town to the 
              NW of Lens in NE France. Scene of an unsuccessful British attack 
              on the German line (25 September-8 October 1915), in which 60,000 
              men were killed, wounded or captured. <a class="glossary"   href="../maps/western_front.htm" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('Image2','','../graphics/icon_map_over.gif',1)"  onClick= "PRO_openPopupWindow('../maps/western_front.htm','popup','600','400','menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes','yes');return document.MM_returnValue" target="_blank"><img name="Image2" border="0" src="../graphics/icon_map.gif" width="43" height="12" alt="map"></a></p>

              in Belgium and under Hindenburg in eastern Prussia in 1914; appointed 
              joint supreme commander of the German army - again with Hindenburg 
              - in August 1916; suffered a breakdown after the failure of the 
              Ludendorff offensive on the Western Front in the spring and early 
              summer of 1918.<br>
              <br>
              <span class="titlesub"><b>Ludendorff offensive<a  name="Ludendorffoffensive"></a></b></span> Germany's final bid for victory on the Western Front between March 
              and July 1918. It was, in fact, a series of small operations that 
              were characterised by initial German breakthroughs that proved impossible 
              to follow up.</p>

              of the then neutral USA. Both Germany and Britain made great propaganda 
              play of the incident.</p>
