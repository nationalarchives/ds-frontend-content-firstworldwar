              Force in May 1917, he aroused Allied hostility - particularly from 
              the French prime minister, Clemenceau - for his unbending refusal 
              to deploy American troops in large numbers on the Western Front 
              until a very late stage in the war. The first major American offensive 
              did not take place until the attack on the St Mihiel salient in 
              mid-September 1918.</p>
            <p><span class="titlesub"><b>Persia</b></span> <a  name="Persia"></a> Former 
              name (until 1935) of Iran. The unstable Persian kingdom, subject 
              to strong Anglo-Russian commercial rivalry before 1914, remained 
              neutral during the First World War but was the site of a number 
              of skirmishes between the Allies and the Central Powers. It was 
              occupied by both British and Russian forces towards the end of the 
              war - they eventually withdrew in, respectively, 1921 and 1925.

              main line of Italian defence during the First World War, towards 
              which Italian forces retreated after defeat at the Battle of Caporetto 
              (24 October-12 November 1917). <a class="glossary"   href="../maps/eastern_front.htm" onMouseOut="MM_swapImgRestore()" onMouseOver="MM_swapImage('Image25','','../graphics/icon_map_over.gif',1)"  onClick= "PRO_openPopupWindow('../maps/eastern_front.htm','popup','600','400','menubar=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes','yes');return document.MM_returnValue" target="_blank"><img name="Image25" border="0" src="../graphics/icon_map.gif" width="43" height="12" alt="map"></a></p>

              troops placed in advance of a position to give early warning of 
              attack.</p>
            <p><span class="titlesub"><b>Poincar&eacute;<a  name="Poincare"></a>, 
              Raymond</b></span> (1860-1934) Five-time French prime minister and president 
              of the French Republic, 1913-20. Appointed his former enemy Georges 
              Clemenceau as prime minister in 1917. Both men were conservative 
              nationalists, strongly opposed to a negotiated peace with Germany.</p>
            <p><span class="titlesub"><b>Poison gas<a  name="poisongas"></a></b></span> Principal chemical weapon used by both sides during the First World 
              War. First used on a large scale when the Germans attacked French 
              and Canadian troops with chlorine gas at the 2nd Battle of Ypres 
              (April 1915). Increasingly lethal agents such as phosgene, hydrogen 
              cyanide and mustard gas were deployed at later stages in the conflict, 
              but their deadly effect was countered by the introduction of respirators 
              ('gas masks') and other anti-gas measures. A total of 124,000 tons 
              of poison gas were dropped during the First World War, causing 1.3 
              million casualties but just 91,000 deaths.</p>

              Interim government set up in Russia after the abdication of Tsar 
              Nicholas II during the March 1917 revolution. It was led from July 
              1917 by Alexander Kerensky and continued to support Russia's participation 
              in the war against the Central Powers. The Provisional Government 
              was overthrown in the Bolshevik coup of November 1917.</p>

              Habsburg fortress town in the province of Galicia. Captured by Russian
